The Arcade Google Drive toolkit provides a pre-built set of tools for interacting with Google Drive. These tools make it easy to build agents and AI apps that can:

- Search Google documents in the user's Google Drive
- Search and retrieve the contents of Google documents in the user's Google Drive

## Available Tools

These tools are currently available in the Arcade Google Drive toolkit.

<Tip>
  If you need to perform an action that's not listed here, you can [get in touch
  with us](mailto:contact@arcade.dev) to request a new tool, or [create your
  own tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) with the [Google auth
  provider](/home/auth-providers/google#using-google-auth-in-custom-tools).

## GoogleDrive.GetFileTreeStructure

<br />
<TabbedCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "Call the Tool with User Authorization",
      content: {
        Python: [
          "/examples/integrations/toolkits/google/drive/get_file_tree_structure_example_call_tool.py",
        ],
        JavaScript: ["/examples/integrations/toolkits/google/drive/get_file_tree_structure_example_call_tool.js"],
      },
    }
  ]}
/>

Get the file/folder tree structure of the user's Google Drive.

**Parameters**

- **`include_shared_drives`** _(bool, optional)_ Whether to include shared drives in the file tree structure. Defaults to False.
- **`restrict_to_shared_drive_id`** _(str, optional)_ If provided, only include files from this shared drive in the file tree structure. Defaults to None, which will include files and folders from all drives.
- **`include_organization_domain_documents`** _(bool, optional)_ Whether to include documents from the organization's domain. This is applicable to admin users who have permissions to view organization-wide documents in a Google Workspace account. Defaults to False.
- **`order_by`** _(enum ([OrderBy](#orderby)), optional)_ Sort order. Defaults to listing the most recently modified documents first.
- **`limit`** _(int, optional)_ The number of files and folders to list. Defaults to None, which will list all files and folders.

## GoogleDrive.GenerateGoogleFilePickerUrl

<br />
<TabbedCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "Call the Tool with User Authorization",
      content: {
        Python: [
          "/examples/integrations/toolkits/google/drive/generate_google_file_picker_url_example_call_tool.py",
        ],
        JavaScript: ["/examples/integrations/toolkits/google/drive/generate_google_file_picker_url_example_call_tool.js"],
      },
    }
  ]}
/>

Generate a Google File Picker URL for user-driven file selection and authorization.

This tool generates a URL that directs the end-user to a Google File Picker interface where
where they can select or upload Google Drive files. Users can grant permission to access their
Drive files, providing a secure and authorized way to interact with their files.

This is particularly useful when prior tools (e.g., those accessing or modifying
Google Docs, Google Sheets, etc.) encountered failures due to file non-existence
(Requested entity was not found) or permission errors. Once the user completes the file
picker flow, the prior tool can be retried.

## Auth

The Arcade Google Drive toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google) to connect to users' Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.
