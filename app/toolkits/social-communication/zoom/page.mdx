<Tip>
  If you need to perform an action that's not listed here, you can [get in touch
  with us](mailto:contact@arcade.dev) to request a new tool, or [create your own
  tools](/home/authoring-tools/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) with the [Zoom auth
  provider](/home/hosting-options/auth-providers/zoom#using-zoom-auth-in-custom-tools).
</Tip>

## Zoom.ListUpcomingMeetings

List a Zoom user's upcoming meetings within the next 24 hours.

**Parameters**

- **`user_id`** _(string, optional)_ The user's user ID or email address. Defaults to 'me' for the current user.

---

## Zoom.GetMeetingInvitation

Retrieve the invitation note for a specific Zoom meeting.

**Parameters**

- **`meeting_id`** _(string, required)_ The meeting's numeric ID (as a string).

---

## Auth

The Arcade Zoom toolkit uses the [Zoom auth provider](/home/hosting-options/auth-providers/zoom) to connect to users' Zoom accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade ` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.


With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Zoom auth provider](/home/hosting-options/auth-providers/zoom#configuring-zoom-auth) with your own Zoom app credentials.
