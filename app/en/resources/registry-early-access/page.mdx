# The Arcade Registry

The Arcade Registry is how agentic tool developers share their work with the world.

Arcade is collecting all the integrations that agents will ever need in one place - think HuggingFace or Pypi but for LLM tools. A powerful community of open source and for-profit developers building out robust and evaluated workflows is how agents can elevate to being _truly_ useful.

Unlike traditional read-only tool libraries, Arcade couples the runtime with the registry. This way Arcade can collect real metrics and usage information about your tools, sharing meaningful information and feedback back to the developers. You'll get error reports and statistics about how your tools are getting used. Arcade also makes it possible for developers to optionally choose to sell their tools with a markup on top of the Arcade platform fees.

Thanks to the Arcade Engine, your MCP servers will be available via all the protocols Arcade supports - be that MCP for locally running applications, OXP for server applications, and whatever comes next. Use the open-source Arcade SDKs to future-proof your tools.

Beta testers who find building, maintaining, and sharing MCP servers with the world in either a free-to-use or for-profit manner interesting should sign up today to join the Arcade Registry Beta.
