  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Salesforce Auth Provider. To use
  Salesforce auth and MCP Sever, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your
  own Salesforce OAuth 2.0 credentials as documented in [Salesforce Auth
  Provider](/home/auth-providers/salesforce).

The Arcade Salesforce CRM MCP Server provides a pre-built set of tools for interacting with Accounts, Leads, Contacts, etc in the Salesforce CRM. These tools make it easy to build agents and AI apps that can:

- Search for Accounts and Contacts by keywords or retrieve them by ID
- Read information about Accounts, such as company metadata, opportunities, deals, etc.
- Read information about Contacts, such as name, email addresses, phone numbers, email messages, call logs, notes, meetings, tasks, etc.
- Create contacts

## Install and Run the Arcade Engine

At this time, you need to [self-host](/home/auth-providers/salesforce) the Arcade Engine to use the Salesforce MCP Sever. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the [Salesforce Auth Provider](/home/auth-providers/salesforce) page.

## Install

```bash
pip install arcade_salesforce
```

  In order to use the Salesforce MCP Sever, you must [self-host the Arcade
  Engine](/guides/deployment-hosting/configure-engine) and [configure the Salesforce
  auth provider](/home/auth-providers/salesforce). The Arcade Engine is
  available at `http://localhost:9099` by default. In the code examples below,
  if necessary, adjust the `base_url` (in Python) or `baseURL` (in JavaScript)
  parameter in the `Arcade` client constructor to match your environment.

## Self-hosting the Arcade Engine with Salesforce Auth

At this time, Arcade Cloud does not support Salesforce auth.
