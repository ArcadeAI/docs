# Build Your First AI Agent with Arcade

Most AI apps are stuck in read-only mode. They can answer questions, but they can't do anything. Arcade changes that.

With Arcade, your AI agents can take real actions: send emails through Gmail, update calendar events, message in Slack, and connect to 100+ other tools â€” all without building OAuth flows or managing API credentials yourself.

## What You'll Build

In this quickstart, you'll build a Morning Briefing Agent that:

- Reads yesterday's emails from your Gmail inbox
- Fetches today's calendar events from Google Calendar
- Uses an LLM to generate a personalized briefing
- Sends the briefing directly to you via Slack DM

This is a real agent that takes real actions across multiple platforms. You'll go from zero to a working agent in under 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. An Arcade account - Sign up at https://account.arcade.dev/register if you haven't already
2. Your Arcade API key - Get it from your Arcade dashboard at https://account.arcade.dev/dashboard/api-keys
3. An OpenAI API key - Get one from OpenAI's platform at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
4. Python 3.11+ installed on your machine
5. Active accounts for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Slack

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, create a new directory for your agent and set up a virtual environment:

```bash
mkdir morning-briefing-agent
cd morning-briefing-agent

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required packages:
uv pip install langchain-arcade langchain-openai langgraph
uv pip install python-dotenv
uv pip install langchain
```

## Step 2: Configure Your API Keys

Create a `.env` file in your project directory with your API keys:

```bash
ARCADE_API_KEY=your_arcade_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore`.

## Step 3: Build the Agent

Create a new file called `morning_briefing.py` and add the following code:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from arcadepy import Arcade
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import os

load_dotenv()

# Initialize the Arcade client
client = Arcade()

# Set your user ID (use the email you signed up with)
user_id = "your-email@example.com"  # Replace this with your email

# Initialize the LLM
llm = init_chat_model(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
)

    auth_response = client.tools.authorize(
        user_id=user_id,

    )

    if auth_response.status != "completed":
        print(f"Please authorize {tool_name}:")
        print(f"ðŸ‘‰ {auth_response.url}")
        auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response.id)
        print(f"âœ“ {tool_name} authorized")

def get_yesterday_inbox_emails() -> dict:

        }
    )

    }

            "min_end_datetime": today_end.isoformat(),
            "max_results": 20
        }
    )

    events = response.output.value.get("events", [])
    return {
        "count": len(events),
        "events": events
    }

def get_slack_user_info() -> dict:

def send_slack_message(user_email: str, message: str) -> None:

        }
    )

    print("âœ“ Morning briefing sent to Slack")

def generate_briefing(email_data: dict, calendar_data: dict) -> str:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_morning_briefing()
```

**Important:** Update the `user_id` variable on line 71 with the email address you used to sign up for Arcade.

## Step 4: Run Your Agent

Now for the exciting part - let's run your agent:

```bash
python morning_briefing.py
```

### First-Time Authorization

When you run the agent for the first time, you'll see authorization prompts for each tool:

```
ðŸŒ… Starting Morning Briefing Agent...

ðŸ“§ Fetching yesterday's inbox emails...
Checking authorization for Gmail.SearchThreads...
Please authorize Gmail.SearchThreads:
ðŸ‘‰ https://arcade.dev/auth/authorize/...
```

What's happening here? Arcade is managing the entire OAuth flow for you. Click each authorization link, grant access, and Arcade securely stores the credentials. You'll only need to do this once per tool.

After authorizing all three tools (Gmail, Google Calendar, and Slack), your agent will:

- Fetch your emails from yesterday
- Retrieve today's calendar events
- Generate a personalized briefing using AI
- Send the briefing to your Slack DMs

Check your Slack - you should see your personalized morning briefing!

## What Just Happened?

Let's break down what Arcade did for you:

### Authentication Made Simple

```python
auth_response = client.tools.authorize(
    user_id=user_id,
    tool_name=tool_name,
)
```

No OAuth flows to build. No API credentials to manage. Arcade handles everything.

### Tool Execution

```python
response = client.tools.execute(
    user_id=user_id,
    tool_name="Gmail.SearchThreads",
    input={"date_range": "yesterday", "label_ids": ["INBOX"]}
)
```

Clean, simple API calls to real-world tools. The same pattern works for 100+ tools.

### Real Actions

```python
client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="Slack.SendMessage",
    input={"emails": [user_email], "message": briefing}
)
```

Your agent doesn't just read data - it takes action. This is what makes it truly useful.

## Understanding the Code

This agent demonstrates the core pattern for building with Arcade:

1. **Authorize once** - Users click authorization links the first time
2. **Execute tools** - Call any tool with a simple, consistent API
3. **Combine with AI** - Use LLMs to analyze data and make decisions
4. **Take action** - Execute tools that create, update, or send real data

The same pattern works whether you're building a simple script or a complex multi-agent system.

## Next Steps

Now that you've built your first agent, here's what to explore next:

### Customize Your Agent

Modify the `generate_briefing()` prompt to match your preferences:

- Change the tone (more formal, more casual)
- Add specific email filtering logic
- Include additional context about your priorities

### Add More Tools

Explore Arcade's 100+ tools and add new capabilities:

- **Linear** - Check your assigned issues
- **Notion** - Read from your workspace
- **GitHub** - Monitor repository activity
- And many more...

## Troubleshooting

### Authorization Links Not Working

Make sure your `ARCADE_API_KEY` is correct in your `.env` file and that you're using the correct `user_id` (the email you signed up with).

### No Emails or Events Returned

- Verify you have emails from yesterday in your Gmail inbox
- Confirm you have calendar events scheduled for today
- Check that you clicked all three authorization links

### OpenAI Rate Limits

If you're on OpenAI's free tier, you may hit rate limits. Consider adding a small amount of credit to your OpenAI account.
