# On-premise MCP Servers

<GuideOverview>
<GuideOverview.Outcomes>

An on-premises MCP server deployment allows you to execute tools in your own environment while still leveraging Arcade's cloud Engine infrastructure. This gives you the flexibility to access private resources, maintain data security, and customize your environment while leveraging Arcade's MCP server management and federation capabilities.

</GuideOverview.Outcomes>

<GuideOverview.Prerequisites>

- [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup)
- [Arcade CLI](/home/quickstart)
- [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

## How on-premises MCP servers work

You can make your MCP server accessible to others by exposing it through a secure tunnel and registering it with Arcade. This allows remote users and services to interact with your tools without deploying to a cloud platform.

The on-premises MCP server model uses a bidirectional connection between your local environment and Arcade's cloud engine:

1. You run the Arcade MCP server in your environment (on-premises, private cloud, etc.)
2. Your MCP server is exposed to Arcade's cloud engine using a public URL
3. The Arcade cloud engine routes tool calls to your MCP server
4. Your MCP server processes the requests and returns responses to the engine

## Benefits of on-premises MCP servers

- **Resource access**: Access private databases, APIs, and other resources not accessible from Arcade's cloud
- **Data control**: Keep sensitive data within your environment while still using Arcade's capabilities
- **Custom environments**: Use specific dependencies or configurations required by your tools
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements by keeping data processing within your infrastructure

## Setting up an on-premises MCP server

<Steps>

### Setup your MCP Servers

Follow the [Creating a MCP Server](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server) guide to create your MCP Server.

### Start your local MCP Server

Ensure you are logged in to Arcade:

<Tabs items={["CLI", "Environment Variable"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```bash
arcade login
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

Add the environment variables to your shell:

```bash
export ARCADE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export ARCADE_USER_ID=<your-user-id>
```

or to a `.env` file:

```env filename=".env"
ARCADE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
ARCADE_USER_ID=<your-user-id>
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Start your MCP server with HTTP transport:

```bash
# Navigate to your entrypoint file
cd my_server/src/my_server

# Run with HTTP transport (default)
uv run server.py
uv run server.py http
```

Your server will start on `http://localhost:8000`. Keep this terminal running.

## Create a Secure Tunnel

Open a **separate terminal** and create a tunnel using one of these options:

- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is easy to set up and works across all platforms.
- [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) provides persistent URLs and advanced features.
- [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/tailscale-funnel) is ideal for sharing within a team or organization.

  [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is easy to set up and works across all platforms.

1. **Install ngrok:**

   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ngrok

   # Or download from https://ngrok.com/download
   ```

2. **Create a tunnel:**

   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

3. **Copy your URL:**
   Look for the "Forwarding" line in the ngrok output:

   ```
   Forwarding  https://abc123.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8000
   ```

   Copy the `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app` URL - this is your public URL.

**Pros:**

- Quick setup, no account required for basic use
- Automatic HTTPS
- Web dashboard to inspect requests

**Cons:**

- Free tier URLs change on each restart
- May show interstitial page for free tier

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) provides persistent URLs and advanced features.

1. **Install cloudflared:**

   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared

   # Or download from https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/
   ```

2. **Create a tunnel:**

   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Copy your URL:**
   Look for the "Your quick Tunnel has been created" message with your URL.

**Pros:**

- Free tier includes persistent URLs (with setup)
- Built-in DDoS protection
- Access control features

**Cons:**

- Requires Cloudflare account for persistent URLs
- More complex setup for advanced features

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

[Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/tailscale-funnel) is ideal for sharing within a team or organization.

1. **Install Tailscale:**

   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install tailscale

   # Or download from https://tailscale.com/download
   ```

2. **Authenticate:**

   ```bash
   tailscale up
   ```

3. **Create a funnel:**

   ```bash
   tailscale funnel 8000
   ```

4. **Get your URL:**
   Tailscale will display your funnel URL (e.g., `https://my-machine.tail-scale.ts.net`)

**Pros:**

- Persistent URLs tied to your machine
- Private by default (only shared with specified users)
- No bandwidth limits

**Cons:**

- Requires Tailscale account
- Best for team/organization use cases

### Register your MCP Server in Arcade

Once you have a public URL, register your MCP server in the Arcade dashboard to make it accessible through the Arcade API.

1. **Navigate to the MCP Servers page** in your [Arcade dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/servers)

2. **Click "Add Server"**

3. **Fill in the registration form:**

   - **ID**: Choose a unique identifier (e.g., `my-mcp-server`)
   - **Server Type**: Select "Arcade"
   - **URL**: Enter your public tunnel URL from Step 2
   - **Secret**: Enter a secret for your server (or use `dev` for testing)
   - **Timeout**: Configure request timeout (default: 30s)
   - **Retry**: Configure retry attempts (default: 3)

4. **Click "Create"**

Here's an example of a configuration:

```yaml
ID: my-mcp-server
Server Type: Arcade
URL: https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
Secret: my-secure-secret-123
Timeout: 30s
Retry: 3
```

### Test the connection to your MCP Server

You can now test your MCP Server by making requests using the Playground, or an MCP client:

<Tabs items={["Playground", "MCP Client"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

1. **Go to the [Arcade Playground](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/playground/chat)**

2. **Select your MCP server** from the dropdown

3. **Choose a tool** from your server

4. **Execute the tool** with test parameters

5. **Verify the response:**
   - Check that the response is correct
   - View request logs in your local server terminal
   - Inspect the tunnel dashboard for request details

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

1. Use an app that supports MCP clients, like AI assistants and IDEs:
   - [Visual Studio Code](/home/mcp-clients/visual-studio-code)
   - [Claude Desktop](/home/mcp-clients/claude-desktop)
   - [Cursor](/home/mcp-clients/cursor)
1. Enable your MCP Server from the list of available MCP Servers
1. Verify that the response is correct and you see request logs in your MCP Server

## Key Concepts

- **HTTP Transport** Run your server with HTTP transport to expose your tools via a REST/SSE API
- **Secure Tunnels** Create a secure tunnel to expose your server publicly
- **Arcade Registration** Register your server in Arcade to make it accessible through the Arcade API
- **Playground Testing** Test your server with the Arcade Playground

## Best practices

- **Persistent URLs**: For production use, set up a persistent public URL rather than ephemeral ones
- **TLS**: Use a TLS-enabled URL for production use
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for your MCP Server to ensure availability

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection issues**: Ensure your public URL is accessible and that your local MCP Server is running
- **Timeout errors**: If your MCP Server takes too long to respond, increase the timeout value in the MCP Server configuration
