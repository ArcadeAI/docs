# Dropbox

<Callout type="info">
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Dropbox Auth Provider. To use
  Dropbox auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Dropbox
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Callout>

The Dropbox auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Dropbox API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Dropbox auth provider seamlessly manage Dropbox OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Dropbox auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-dropbox-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Dropbox APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-dropbox-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Dropbox APIs

## Configuring Dropbox auth

<Callout type="info">
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to
  use a [custom user
  verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier).
  Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in
  production.
</Callout>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Dropbox app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.


Before showing how to configure your Dropbox app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Dropbox app.

### Create a Dropbox app

- Create a Dropbox Application in the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
- In the Settings tab, under the "OAuth 2" section, set the redirect URI to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
- In the Permissions tab, add any scopes that your app will need
- In the Settings tab, copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you'll need below

Next, add the Dropbox app to your Arcade Engine configuration.

### Configure Dropbox Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Dropbox**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-dropbox-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Dropbox app.
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be added to your Dropbox app's Redirect URIs.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Dropbox auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Dropbox OAuth provider. If you have multiple Dropbox providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Dropbox auth in app code

Use the Dropbox auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Dropbox API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Dropbox API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python {8-12}
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="dropbox",
    scopes=["openid", "sharing.read", "files.metadata.read"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript {8-10}
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "dropbox", {
  scopes: ["openid", "sharing.read", "files.metadata.read"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Dropbox auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server) that interact with the Dropbox API.

Use the `Dropbox()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Dropbox. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Dropbox token:

```python {5-6,9-13,23}
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Dropbox


@tool(
    requires_auth=Dropbox(
        scopes=["files.metadata.read"],
    )
)
async def list_files(
    context: ToolContext,
    path: Annotated[
        Optional[str],
        "The path to the folder to list the contents of. Defaults to empty string to list the root folder.",
    ] = "",
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of servers the user is a member of"]:
    """Starts returning the contents of a folder."""
    url = "https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/files/list_folder"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json={"path": path})
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
