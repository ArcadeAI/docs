# Reddit

<Callout type="info">
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Reddit Auth Provider. To use
  Reddit auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Reddit OAuth
  2.0 credentials as described below.
</Callout>

The Reddit auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Reddit API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Reddit auth provider seamlessly manage Reddit OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Reddit auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-reddit-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Reddit APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-reddit-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Reddit APIs

## Configuring Reddit auth

<Callout type="info">
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to
  use a [custom user
  verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier).
  Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in
  production.
</Callout>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Reddit app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.


Before showing how to configure your Reddit app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Reddit app.

### Create a Reddit app

- Create a Reddit Application in the [Reddit App Console](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
- Set the OAuth Redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
- Copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you'll need below

Next, add the Reddit app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Reddit Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Reddit app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure Reddit Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Reddit**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-reddit-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Reddit app.
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Reddit app's OAuth Redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Reddit auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Reddit OAuth provider. If you have multiple Reddit providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Reddit auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

<Callout type="info">
  The Client ID is the Reddit "App key" and the Client Secret is the Reddit "App
  secret".
</Callout>

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```


### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `reddit` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml {3-9}
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-reddit
      description: "The default Reddit provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: reddit
      client_id: ${env:REDDIT_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

</Steps>

## Using Reddit auth in app code

Use the Reddit auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Reddit API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Reddit API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python {8-12}
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="reddit",
    scopes=["identity"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# TODO: Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript {8-10}
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "reddit", {
  scopes: ["identity"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Reddit auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server) that interact with the Reddit API.

Use the `Reddit()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Reddit. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Reddit token:

```python {5-6,9-13,20}
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Reddit


@tool(
    requires_auth=Reddit(
        scopes=["identity"],
    )
)
async def get_user_info(
    context: ToolContext,
) -> Annotated[dict, "The user info"]:
    """Get the user info for the current user."""
    url = "https://oauth.reddit.com/api/v1/me"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
        "User-Agent": "YourAppName v1.0 by u/YourRedditUsername",
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
