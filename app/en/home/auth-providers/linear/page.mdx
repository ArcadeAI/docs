# Linear

The Linear auth provider enables tools and agents to call [Linear APIs](https://linear.app/developers/graphql) on behalf of a user.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Linear auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-linear-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the Linear API
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-Linear-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the Linear API

## Configuring Linear auth

<Callout type="info">
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to
  use a [custom user
  verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier).
  Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in
  production.
</Callout>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Linear app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.


Before showing how to configure your Linear app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Linear app.

### Create a Linear app

- It is **highly recommended** to first [create a new Linear workspace](https://linear.app/join) for the purpose of managing the OAuth2 Application.
- Create a new public OAuth2 Application in your [integration's settings page](https://linear.app/settings/api/applications/new).
- Fill out your application specific information such as application name and description.
- Set the Callback URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
- Toggle the **Public** switch to enable public access to the application if you want other workspaces to be able to use your application.
- Once you complete creating your integration, copy the client ID and client secret to use below.

Next, add the Linear app to your Arcade Engine configuration.

### Configure Linear Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Linear**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-linear-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Linear app.
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Linear app's Callback URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Linear auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Linear OAuth provider. If you have multiple Linear providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Linear auth in app code

Use the Linear auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Linear API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Linear API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python {8-14}
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="linear",
    scopes=[
        "read"
    ],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript {8-10}
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "linear", {
  scopes: ["read"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Linear auth in custom tools

You can use the pre-built [Arcade Linear MCP Server](/mcp-servers/productivity/linear) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Linear.

If the pre-built tools in the Linear MCP Server don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server) that interact with the Linear API.

Use the `Linear()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Linear. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Linear token:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Any

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Linear

import httpx


@tool(requires_auth=Linear(scopes=["read"]))
async def get_teams(context: ToolContext) -> Annotated[dict[str, Any], "Teams in the workspace with member information"]:
    """Get Linear teams and team information including team members"""
    token = context.get_auth_token_or_empty()
    url = "https://api.linear.app/graphql"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/json",
    }

    query = """
    query Teams {
      teams {
        nodes {
          id
          name
          key
        }
      }
    }
    """

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
      resp = await client.post(url, json={"query": query}, headers=headers)
      resp.raise_for_status()
      data = resp.json()
      teams = data["data"]["teams"]["nodes"]
      return teams
```
