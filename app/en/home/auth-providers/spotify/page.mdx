# Spotify

<Callout type="info">
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Spotify Auth Provider. To use
  Spotify auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Spotify
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Callout>

The Spotify auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Spotify API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Spotify auth provider seamlessly manage Spotify OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Spotify auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-spotify-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Spotify APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-spotify-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Spotify APIs

## Configuring Spotify auth

<Callout type="info">
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to
  use a [custom user
  verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier).
  Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in
  production.
</Callout>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Spotify app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.


Before showing how to configure your Spotify app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Spotify app.

### Create a Spotify app

- Follow Spotify's guide to [registering an app](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)
- Choose the "Web API" product (at a minimum)
- Set the redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Spotify app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Spotify Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Spotify app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure Spotify Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Spotify**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-spotify-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Spotify app.
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Spotify app's redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Spotify auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Spotify OAuth provider. If you have multiple Spotify providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Spotify auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```



### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `spotify` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml {3-9}
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-spotify
      description: "The default Spotify provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: spotify
      client_id: ${env:SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

</Steps>

</Tabs.Tab>

## Using Spotify auth in app code

Use the Spotify auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Spotify API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Spotify API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python {8-12}
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="spotify",
    scopes=["user-read-playback-state"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript {8-10}
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "spotify", [
  "user-read-playback-state",
]);

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Spotify auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server) that interact with the Spotify API.

Use the `Spotify()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Spotify. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Spotify token:

```python {5-6,9-13,19}
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Spotify


@tool(
    requires_auth=Spotify(
        scopes=["user-read-playback-state"],
    )
)
async def get_playback_state(
    context: ToolContext,
) -> Annotated[dict, "Information about the user's current playback state"]:
    """Get information about the user's current playback state, including track or episode, progress, and active device."""
    endpoint = "/me/player"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(
            f"https://api.spotify.com/v1/{endpoint}",
            headers=headers,
        )
        response.raise_for_status()

        if response.status_code == 204:
            return {"status": "Playback not available or active"}
        return response.json()
```
