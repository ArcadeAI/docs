# Figma

The Figma auth provider enables tools and agents to call [Figma APIs](https://www.figma.com/developers/api) on behalf of a user using OAuth 2.0 authentication.

<Callout>
  Want to quickly get started with Figma in your agent or AI app? The pre-built
  [Arcade Figma MCP Server](/mcp-servers/productivity/figma-api) is what you
  want!
</Callout>

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Figma auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Figma MCP Server](/mcp-servers/productivity/figma-api), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Figma
- Your [app code](#using-figma-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the Figma API
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-figma-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the Figma API

## Configuring Figma auth

<Callout type="info">
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to
  use a [custom user
  verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier).
  Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in
  production.
</Callout>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Figma app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

Before showing how to configure your Figma app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Figma app.

### Create a Figma app

To integrate with Figma's API, you'll need to set up OAuth 2.0 authentication by creating an app in the Figma Developer Portal:

<Steps>

#### Access the Figma Developer Portal

Navigate to the [Figma Developer Portal](https://www.figma.com/developers/) and sign in with your existing Figma credentials or create a new account.

#### Create a new app

1. Once logged in, go to your developer dashboard and select "My Apps"
2. Click on "Create a new app"
3. Fill in the required details:
   - **App Name**: Choose a descriptive name for your application
   - **Website**: Provide the URL of your application's website
   - **App Logo**: Upload a 100x100px PNG image representing your app

#### Set up OAuth configuration

1. After creating your app, you'll receive a `client_id` and `client_secret`
2. Set the redirect URI to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see configuration section below)
3. Configure the required scopes for your application:
   - `files:read` - Read access to files
   - `file_comments:write` - Write access to file comments
   - Add other scopes as needed for your use case

</Steps>

For detailed instructions, refer to Figma's official [Authentication documentation](https://developers.figma.com/docs/rest-api/authentication/).

Next, add the Figma app to Arcade.

### Configure Figma Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **OAuth 2.0** tab at the top.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "arcade-figma").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Figma app.
- Configure the OAuth 2.0 endpoints:
  - **Authorization URL**: `https://www.figma.com/oauth`
  - **Token URL**: `https://www.figma.com/api/oauth/token`
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Figma app's redirect URI.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used.

</Steps>

### Configure Figma Auth Using Configuration File

<Callout type="info">
  This method is only available when you are [self-hosting the
  engine](/home/deployment/on-prem-mcp)
</Callout>

<Steps>

#### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export FIGMA_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
FIGMA_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

#### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a new item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml
auth:
  providers:
    - id: arcade-figma
      description: Figma OAuth 2.0 provider
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      client_id: ${env:FIGMA_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET}
      oauth2:
        scope_delimiter: ","
        authorize_request:
          endpoint: "https://www.figma.com/oauth"
          params:
            response_type: code
            client_id: "{{client_id}}"
            redirect_uri: "{{redirect_uri}}"
            scope: "{{scopes}}"
            state: "{{state}}"
        token_request:
          endpoint: "https://www.figma.com/api/oauth/token"
          auth_method: client_secret_basic
          params:
            grant_type: authorization_code
            client_id: "{{client_id}}"
            client_secret: "{{client_secret}}"
            redirect_uri: "{{redirect_uri}}"
          response_content_type: application/json
```

</Steps>

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

When you use tools that require Figma auth using your Arcade account credentials, Arcade will automatically use this Figma OAuth provider. If you have multiple Figma providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Figma auth in app code

Use the Figma auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Figma API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Figma API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python {8-12}
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="arcade-figma",
    scopes=["files:read", "file_comments:write"]
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript {8-11}
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "arcade-figma", [
  "files:read",
  "file_comments:write",
]);

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Figma auth in custom tools

You can use the pre-built [Arcade Figma MCP Server](/mcp-servers/productivity/figma-api) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Figma.

If the pre-built tools in the Figma MCP Server don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server) that interact with the Figma API.

Use the `OAuth2()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Figma. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Figma token:

```python {8-12,22}
from typing import Annotated

import httpx
from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import OAuth2


@tool(
    requires_auth=OAuth2(
        provider_id="arcade-figma",
        scopes=["files:read"]
    )
)
async def get_figma_file(
    context: ToolContext,
    file_key: Annotated[str, "The Figma file key to retrieve."],
) -> Annotated[dict, "The Figma file data."]:
    """
    Retrieve a Figma file by its key.
    """
    url = f"https://api.figma.com/v1/files/{file_key}"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": context.authorization.token,
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return dict(response.json())
```

## Available Scopes

Figma supports various OAuth scopes that determine the level of access your application has:

- `files:read` - Read access to files
- `file_comments:write` - Write access to file comments
- `file_dev_resources:write` - Write access to dev resources
- `file_variables:read` - Read access to variables
- `file_variables:write` - Write access to variables
- `webhooks:write` - Write access to webhooks

For a complete list of available scopes and their descriptions, refer to the [Figma API documentation](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#authentication).
