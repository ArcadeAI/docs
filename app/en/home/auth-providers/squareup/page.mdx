# Square

The Square auth provider enables tools and agents to call Square APIs on behalf of a user.

## What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Square auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-square-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Square APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-square-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Square APIs

## Use Arcade's Default Square Auth Provider

Arcade offers a default Square auth provider that you can use in the Arcade Cloud Platform. In this case, your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

If you choose to use Arcade's Square auth, you don't need to configure anything.

## Use Your Own Square App Credentials

<Callout type="info">
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to
  use a [custom user
  verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier).
  Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in
  production.
</Callout>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Square app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

Before showing how to configure your Square app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Square app.

## Create a Square App

Follow the documentation on [Square Developer Platform](https://developer.squareup.com/docs). You will need to create a Square developer account.

When creating your app, use the following settings:

- Set an appropriate App name and description. This will be visible to your users authorizing access to your app.
- In the **OAuth** section:
  - Take note of the **Application ID** (Client ID) and **Application Secret** (Client Secret).
  - Add the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below) to the **Redirect URL** field.
- Configure the appropriate **Permissions** for your application. Common permissions include:
  - `MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ` - Read merchant profile information
  - `PAYMENTS_READ` - Read payment information
  - `ORDERS_READ` - Read order information
  - `ORDERS_WRITE` - Create and update orders
  - `ITEMS_READ` - Read catalog items
  - `ITEMS_WRITE` - Create and update catalog items

## Configuring your own Square Auth Provider in Arcade

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure Square Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Square**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-square-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** (Application ID) and **Client Secret** (Application Secret) from your Square app.
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be added to your Square app's Redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Square auth using your Arcade account credentials, Arcade will automatically use this Square OAuth provider. If you have multiple Square providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Square auth in app code

Use the Square auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Square API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Square API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```python {21-22}
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(base_url="https://api.arcade.dev")  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="squareup",
    scopes=["MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ", "PAYMENTS_READ"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

# Do something interesting with the token...
auth_token = auth_response.context.token
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript {20-21}
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade({ baseURL: "https://api.arcade.dev" }); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "squareup", {
  scopes: ["MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ", "PAYMENTS_READ"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
const response = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

// Do something interesting with the token...
const auth_token = response.context.token;
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

You can use the auth token to call the [Square API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square) endpoints to manage payments, orders, catalog items, and more.

## Using Square auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server) that interact with Square API.

Use the `OAuth2()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Square. The authentication token needed to call the Square API is available in the tool context through the `context.authorization.token` property.

```python {9,17}
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import OAuth2


@tool(requires_auth=OAuth2(provider_id="squareup", scopes=["PAYMENTS_READ"]))
async def list_payments(
    context: ToolContext,
    location_id: Annotated[str, "The ID of the location to list payments for."],
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of payments"]:
    """Retrieves a list of payments for a Square location."""
    url = "https://connect.squareup.com/v2/payments"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Square-Version": "2024-01-18",
    }
    params = {"location_id": location_id}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

Your new tool can be called like demonstrated below:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
<Callout type="info">
  If you are self-hosting, change the `base_url` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.

client = Arcade(base_url="https://api.arcade.dev")  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

USER_ID = "{arcade_user_id}"

auth_response = client.tools.authorize(tool_name=TOOL_NAME, user_id=USER_ID)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print(f"Click this link to authorize: {auth_response.url}")

# Wait for the authorization to complete
client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

tool_input = {
    "location_id": "LOCATION123",
}

response = client.tools.execute(
