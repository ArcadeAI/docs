# Atlassian

<Callout type="info">
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Atlassian Auth Provider. To use
  Atlassian auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Atlassian
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Callout>

The Atlassian auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Atlassian API on behalf of a user.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Atlassian auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-atlassian-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Atlassian APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-atlassian-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Atlassian APIs

## Configuring Atlassian auth

<Callout type="info">
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to
  use a [custom user
  verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier).
  Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in
  production.
</Callout>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Atlassian app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.


Before showing how to configure your Atlassian app credentials, let's go through the steps to create an Atlassian app.

### Create an Atlassian app

- Create a Atlassian app in the [Atlassian developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)
- In the Authorization tab, click the "Add" action button and set the Callback URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
- In the Permissions tab, enable any permissions you need for your app
- In the Settings tab, copy the Client ID and Secret to use below

## Configuring your own Atlassian Auth Provider in Arcade

### Configure Atlassian Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Atlassian**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-atlassian-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Atlassian app.
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be added to your Atlassian app as a Callback URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>
When you use tools that require Atlassian auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Atlassian OAuth provider. If you have multiple Atlassian providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Atlassian auth in app code

Use the Atlassian auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Atlassian API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Atlassian API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python {8-12}
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="atlassian",
    scopes=["read:me", "read:jira-user", "read:confluence-user"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript {8-10}
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "atlassian", {
  scopes: ["read:me", "read:jira-user", "read:confluence-user"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Atlassian auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server) that interact with the Atlassian API.

Use the `Atlassian()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Atlassian. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Atlassian token:

```python {5-6,9-13,23}
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Atlassian


@tool(
    requires_auth=Atlassian(
        scopes=["read:jira-work"],
    )
)
async def list_projects(
    context: ToolContext,
    query: Annotated[
        Optional[str],
        "The query to filter the projects by. Defaults to empty string to list all projects.",
    ] = "",
) -> Annotated[dict, "The list of projects in a user's Jira instance"]:
    """List a Jira user's projects."""
    url = f"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>/rest/api/3/project/search?query={query}"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
