# Cursor with Arcade

Give your Cursor AI assistant access to Arcade's 100+ pre-built tools for real-world actions.

## What you'll set up

Cursor integration that lets your AI:
- Access Gmail, Slack, GitHub, and 100+ other tools
- Take real actions on your behalf
- Use proper authentication and permissions

**Time to complete:** 10 minutes

## Prerequisites

- [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/) installed
- [Arcade API key](/home/api-keys)
- Accounts for tools you want to use (Gmail, Slack, etc.)

## Step 1: Install the Arcade MCP Server

Open your terminal in Cursor and run:

```bash
npx @arcadeai/mcp-server install
```

This will:
- Install the Arcade MCP server
- Configure Cursor to use it
- Set up authentication

## Step 2: Configure your API key

Add your Arcade API key to Cursor's settings:

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd+, or Ctrl+,)
2. Navigate to **MCP Servers**
3. Find **Arcade** in the list
4. Add your API key from [arcade.dev/api-keys](https://arcade.dev/api-keys)

## Step 3: Test the integration

In Cursor's AI chat, try:

```
"Check my Gmail for unread messages from today"
```

Cursor will:
1. Ask you to authorize Gmail (first time only)
2. Fetch your unread messages
3. Show you the results

## Step 4: Use tools in your workflow

### Example prompts:

**Email management:**
```
"Find all emails from sarah@company.com this week"
"Send an email to john@example.com about tomorrow's meeting"
```

**Calendar:**
```
"What meetings do I have today?"
"Schedule a meeting with the team for tomorrow at 2pm"
```

**Slack:**
```
"Send a message to #engineering that the deploy is complete"
"Check my Slack DMs for urgent messages"
```

**GitHub:**
```
"Create a new issue in my-repo about the login bug"
"Check the status of PR #42"
```
