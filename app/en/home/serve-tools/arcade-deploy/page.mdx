# Deploying to the cloud with Arcade Deploy

Running your MCP servers locally is very convenient during development and testing. Once your MCP server is mature, however, you may want to access it from any MCP client, or to facilitate multi-user support. Doing all that from your computer comes with the complexity of running and maintaining a server, handling auth and high availability for all your users and all the integrations you want to support. Arcade Deploy takes care of all that for you. Your MCP server will be accessible to any MCP client. Also, all the tools you create will be available in the larger tool catalog that you can use when building MCP gateways.

This guide shows you how to deploy your MCP Server with Arcade Deploy.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10** or higher <br/> Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
- **Arcade Account**: Sign up for an <SignupLink linkLocation="docs:custom-tools">Arcade account</SignupLink> if you haven't already.
- **Arcade CLI**: Install the Arcade CLI

## Create an MCP server using Arcade MCP

If you have not created an MCP server yet, then follow the steps outlined in [this guide](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server) before deploying.

## Deploy your MCP Server

Run the deploy command in the directory where you started your MCP server (containing your `pyproject.toml` file).

```bash
arcade deploy
```

By default, running `arcade deploy` looks for a file named `server.py` as the entry point to your MCP server.

An entry point file is considered valid if it executes the `run()` method on your `MCPApp` instance when invoked directly - for example, running `uv run your_entrypoint_file.py` should result in your MCP server starting. A minimal valid entry point looks like this:

```py
from arcade_mcp_server import MCPApp

app = MCPApp()

@app.tool
def echo(phrase: Annotated[str, "The phrase to echo"]):
    return phrase

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

If your MCP server uses a different script name or location, specify it with the --entrypoint option. For example, if your `pyproject.toml` is in `~/my-app/mcp-server/` and your entry point file is `~/my-app/mcp-server/server/my_mcp_server.py`, start the deployment with:

```bash
arcade deploy --entrypoint server/my_mcp_server.py
```

<Callout type="info">
  It is important that your entrypoint script executes `MCPApp.run()` (or
  `app.run()` if `app` is of type `MCPApp`) when invoked directly.

We recommend to do it inside an `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement.

</Callout>

You should see output like the following:

```bash

Verifying server and extracting metadata...
✓ Server is healthy
✓ Found server: ArcadeMCP v0.1.0
ArcadeMCP v0.1.0 has 3 tools

Discovered 1 required secret(s)

Required secrets: MY_SECRET_KEY
✓ Secret 'MY_SECRET_KEY' uploaded

Creating deployment package...
✓ Package created (1.8 KB)

Deploying to Arcade Engine...
✓ Server deployed successfully
```

## Manage your MCP servers in Arcade

Navigate to the [Servers](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/servers) page in your Arcade dashboard. From there, you will be able to:

- Monitor the health status of the server
- Get a connection string to configure your MCP clients.
- Delete the server
- Test and execute all the tools
- Manage users connected to the Auth providers
- Create MCP Gateways

## List your MCP servers on the terminal

Run the following command to list your MCP servers:

```bash
arcade server list
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash

</Steps>

Your MCP Server is now deployed and registered with the engine and ready to use!
=======
Coming soon! We're reworking the `arcade deploy` command to be more user-friendly and powerful. In the meantime, you can deploy [on-premises MCP servers](/home/deployment/on-prem-mcp) to make your tools accessible to others.
