# Hosting Options

The easiest and best way to use Arcade is to use our cloud service - sign up for free at [https://api.arcade.dev](https://api.arcade.dev).  However, you might need to connect your tools to local resources (e.g. a local database or filesystem) or keep data within your own infrastructure.  Don't worry, Arcade has you covered!

## MCP Server Deployment

You can route and manage tool calls from your agents to MCP servers hosted anywhere - on your machine, on your own infrastructure, in a private cloud, or on our cloud service.  This allows you to mix the best public tools with your own private tools.

See [On-premise MCP Servers](/home/deployment/on-prem-mcp) for more information about how to use your own MCP servers in a federated deployment, and see [Arcade Deploy](/home/serve-tools/arcade-deploy) to learn how to deploy to Arcade's cloud.

## Customizing Auth

You don't have to host Arcade to customize your auth experiences. Arcade's cloud service supports a number of auth providers out of the box, but you can always provide your own OAuth app credentials. We recommend doing this for any production use-case so that you can have isolated rate limits with the OAuth service provider and give your users a consistent experience when they go through an auth flow.

You can still use the same tools when you customize your auth, no code changes are required.

See [Customizing Auth](/home/auth-providers) for more information.


## On-Premises Deployments

On-premise deployments of the Arcade platform are available, and involve running all of the Arcade services locally.  Arcade can be deployed anywhere on Kubernetes via our Helm charts and docker images as part of our enterprise offering.  [Contact us to learn more](/home/contact-us).
