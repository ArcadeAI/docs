# Agentic Development

Give your AI IDE access to Arcade.dev's documentation using our llms.txt files (short [llms.txt](https://docs.arcade.dev/llms.txt), [llms-full.txt](https://docs.arcade.dev/llms-full.txt)), or use [context7](https://context7.com/arcadeai/docs). This allows Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI IDEs to access the documentation and help you write code.

## LLMs.txt

LLMs.txt is a file format that allows you to give your AI IDE access to Arcade.dev's documentation in a format that can be easily parsed by the LLM. All you need to do is paste in the conent of the file into your IDE's settings, or reference the docs, e.g. via [Cursor's `@docs` annotation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols#docs).

Our LLMs.txt files are available in two versions:

- [`https://docs.arcade.dev/llms.txt`](https://docs.arcade.dev/llms.txt) - a short version of the documentation index
- [`https://docs.arcade.dev/llms-full.txt`](https://docs.arcade.dev/llms-full.txt) - a full version of the documentation

## Context7

Context7 is an MCP server designed to provide Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI code editors with up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples. It helps prevent AI models from "hallucinating" or providing outdated code by fetching accurate information directly from its knowledge base and injecting it into the LLM's prompt, ensuring more reliable and accurate coding assistance

To use Context7, you first need to add the [Context7 MCP server](https://github.com/upstash/context7) to your editor, and then select the [`arcadeai/docs` project](https://context7.com/arcadeai/docs).
