# MCP Gateways

MCP Gateways are a way to connect multiple MCP Servers to your agent, application, or IDE. MCP Gateways allow you to federate the tools from multiple MCP Servers into a single MCP Server. You can mix and match tools from different MCP Servers in the same project, and not all tools from a MCP server need to be available to the same LLM.

## Configure MCP Gateways

To configure an MCP Gateway, go to the [MCP Gateways dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/mcp-gateways) and click on the "Create MCP Gateway" button.

When configuring an MCP Gateway, you can select the tools you want to include in the Gateway from any MCP Servers available to the project:

The options available when configuring an MCP Gateway are:
- **Name**: The name of the MCP Gateway.  Informative only.
- **Description**: The description of the MCP Gateway.  If set, this information will be returned to the LLM to hint at the purpose of the tools within the MCP Gateway.
- **Slug**: The slug of the MCP Gateway.  This is the URL slug that will be used to access the MCP Gateway.  It must be unique.
- **Allowed Tools**: If set, only the tools in the MCP Servers that are selected will be available to the MCP Gateway.  If left blank, all tools from the MCP Servers available to the project will be available through the MCP Gateway.
