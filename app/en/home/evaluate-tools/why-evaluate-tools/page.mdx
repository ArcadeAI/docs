# Why evaluate tools?

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-[4fr_3fr] gap-8">
  <div>
    Tool evaluations ensure AI models use your tools correctly in production. Unlike traditional testing, evaluations measure two key aspects:

    1. **Tool selection**: Does the model choose the right tools for the task?
    2. **Parameter accuracy**: Does the model provide correct arguments?

    Arcade's evaluation framework helps you validate tool-calling capabilities before deployment, ensuring reliability in real-world applications. You can evaluate tools from MCP servers, Arcade Gateways, or custom implementations.

## What can go wrong?

Without proper evaluation, AI models might:

- **Misinterpret user intents**, selecting the wrong tools
- **Provide incorrect arguments**, causing failures or unexpected behavior
- **Skip necessary tool calls**, missing steps in multi-step tasks
- **Make incorrect assumptions** about parameter defaults or formats

## How evaluation works

Evaluations compare the model's actual tool calls with expected tool calls for each test case.

### Scoring components

1. **Tool selection**: Did the model choose the correct tool?
2. **Parameter evaluation**: Are the arguments correct? (evaluated by critics)
3. **Weighted scoring**: Each aspect has a weight that affects the final score

### Evaluation results

Each test case receives:

- **Score**: Calculated from weighted critic scores, normalized proportionally (weights can be any positive value)
- **Status**:
  - **Passed**: Score meets or exceeds fail threshold (default: 0.8)
  - **Failed**: Score falls below fail threshold
  - **Warned**: Score is between warn and fail thresholds (default: 0.9)

Example output:

```
PASSED Get weather for city -- Score: 1.00
WARNED Send message with typo -- Score: 0.85
FAILED Wrong tool selected -- Score: 0.50
```

## Next steps

- [Create an evaluation suite](/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite) to start testing your tools
- [Run evaluations](/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations) with multiple providers
- Explore [capture mode](/home/evaluate-tools/capture-mode) to bootstrap test expectations
- Compare tool sources with [comparative evaluations](/home/evaluate-tools/comparative-evaluations)

## Advanced features

Once you're comfortable with basic evaluations, explore these advanced capabilities:

### Capture mode

Record tool calls without scoring to discover what models actually call. Useful for bootstrapping test expectations and debugging. [Learn more →](/home/evaluate-tools/capture-mode)

### Comparative evaluations

Test the same cases against different tool sources (tracks) with isolated registries. Compare how models perform with different tool implementations. [Learn more →](/home/evaluate-tools/comparative-evaluations)

### Output formats

Save results in multiple formats (txt, md, html, json) for reporting and analysis. Mix formats with `--format md,html,json` or use `--format all`. [Learn more →](/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations#output-formats)
