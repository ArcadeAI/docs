# ChatGPT with Arcade

Create a Custom GPT that can access Gmail, Slack, GitHub, and 100+ other tools through Arcade.

## What you'll build

A Custom GPT that can:
- Check your Gmail and send emails
- Manage your calendar
- Post to Slack channels
- Create GitHub issues
- And 100+ other real-world actions

**Time to complete:** 15 minutes

## Prerequisites

- ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise account
- [Arcade API key](/home/api-keys)
- Accounts for tools you want to use (Gmail, Slack, etc.)

## Step 1: Create a Custom GPT

1. Go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Click your profile â†’ **My GPTs**
3. Click **Create a GPT**
4. Choose **Configure** tab

## Step 2: Configure basic settings

**Name:**
```
Arcade Assistant
```

**Description:**
```
An AI assistant with access to Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Calendar, and 100+ other tools via Arcade.
```

**Instructions:**
```
You are an AI assistant with access to real-world tools through Arcade's API. You can:

- Read and send emails via Gmail
- Check and create calendar events
- Send Slack messages
- Create GitHub issues
- Access 100+ other productivity tools

When a user asks you to perform an action:
1. Use the appropriate Arcade tool
2. Handle authentication if needed
3. Execute the action
4. Provide clear feedback about what happened

Always confirm before taking destructive actions like deleting emails or files.
```

## Step 3: Add Arcade Actions

In the **Actions** section:

1. Click **Create new action**
2. Click **Import from URL**
3. Enter: `https://api.arcade-ai.com/openapi.json`
4. Click **Import**

This imports all 100+ Arcade tools as ChatGPT actions.

## Step 4: Configure authentication

1. In the **Actions** section, scroll to **Authentication**
2. Select **API Key**
3. Set **Auth Type** to **Bearer**
4. Enter your [Arcade API key](/home/api-keys)
5. Click **Save**

## Step 5: Test your Custom GPT

Click **Preview** and try:

```
"Check my Gmail for unread messages from today"
```

ChatGPT will:
1. Ask you to authorize Gmail (first time only)
2. Call Arcade's Gmail.ListMessages tool
3. Show you the results

## Step 6: Save and share

1. Click **Save** in the top right
2. Choose who can access:
   - **Only me** - Private use
   - **Anyone with a link** - Share with others
   - **Public** - List in GPT Store

## Example prompts

**Email management:**
```
"Find all emails from sarah@company.com this week"
"Send an email to john@example.com about tomorrow's meeting"
```

**Calendar:**
```
"What meetings do I have today?"
"Schedule a team meeting for tomorrow at 2pm"
```

**Slack:**
```
"Send a message to #engineering that the deploy is complete"
"Check my Slack DMs for urgent messages"
```

**GitHub:**
```
"Create an issue in my-repo about the login bug"
"Check the status of PR #42"
```

**Multi-tool workflows:**
```
"Check my calendar, then send a summary of today's meetings to #team on Slack"
"Find all unread emails, create a summary, and post it to Slack"
```
