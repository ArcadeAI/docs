# When to Build Tools

This is a placeholder page about when to build custom tools.

## Overview

Overview page to direct to the various scenarios in which you'd build a tool.

## Scenarios for Building Tools

### New Functionality
Build tools when you need agent functionality that doesn't exist in current toolkits.

### Performance Optimization
Create custom tools to get more performance from existing agent capabilities.

### Model Compatibility
Update tools to work with the newest language models and their capabilities.

### Integration Requirements
Build tools for specific APIs or systems not covered by existing toolkits.

## Decision Framework

1. **Evaluate existing tools** - Check if current tools meet your needs
2. **Assess performance** - Determine if custom tools would improve results
3. **Consider maintenance** - Factor in ongoing support requirements
4. **Plan for testing** - Create evaluation suites for new tools
