The Google Drive MCP Server provides a set of tools for interacting with Google Drive, enabling users to efficiently manage and access their files. With this MCP Server, users can:

- Retrieve the file and folder structure of their Google Drive
- Search for specific files within Google Drive
- Create, rename, and move files and folders
- Download and upload files
- Share files with other users
- Generate a Google File Picker URL for user-driven file selection and authorization

<Callout>
  If you need to perform an action that's not listed here, you can [get in touch
  with us](mailto:contact@arcade.dev) to request a new tool, or [create your own
  tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server).
</Callout>

Each tool requires specific Google OAuth scopes to function. You'll find the required scopes listed in a blue info box at the end of each tool's documentation below. For more information about configuring OAuth and tips for moving to production, see the [Google auth provider documentation](/home/auth-providers/google).

<Callout type="warning">
  The `drive.file` scope only grants access to files that were created or opened by your application. If you need broader access to a user's Google Drive (e.g., to access files created by other applications), you'll need to create your own Google OAuth provider and request the `drive.readonly` or `drive` scope. Note that these broader scopes are **not supported** by Arcade's default Google OAuth provider.
</Callout>

## Find required scopes

Select the tools you plan to use to see the OAuth scopes your application needs:

    },
  ]}
/>

Generate a Google File Picker URL for user-driven file selection and authorization. This tool generates a URL that directs the end-user to a Google File Picker interface where they can select or upload Google Drive files. Users can grant permission to access their Drive files, providing a secure and authorized way to interact with their files.

This is particularly useful when prior tools encountered failures due to file non-existence or permission errors. Once the user completes the file picker flow, the prior tool can be retried.

**Parameters**

This tool does not take any parameters.

<Callout type="info" title="This tool requires the following scope">
No additional scopes required (uses basic Google authentication).
