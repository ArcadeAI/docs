# Docker Installation

## Engine

### Pulling the Engine Image

The Arcade Engine is stateless and the docker image is designed to scale horizontally for production environments.

The docker image for the engine can be pulled with

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/arcadeai/engine:latest
```

### Running the Engine

The engine can be run with:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9099:9099 -v ./engine.yaml:/bin/engine.yaml ghcr.io/arcadeai/engine:latest
```

where config.yaml is the path to the [configuration file](/home/local-deployment/configure/configuration-templates).
