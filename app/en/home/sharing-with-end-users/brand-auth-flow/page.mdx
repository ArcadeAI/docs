To keep your users safe, Arcade.dev performs a user verification check when a tool is authorized for the first time. This check verifies that the user who is authorizing the tool is the same user who started the authorization flow, which helps prevent phishing attacks.

# Brand your auth flow

There are two ways to secure your auth flows with Arcade.dev:

- Use the **Arcade user verifier** for development. This is enabled by default when you create a new Arcade.dev account and works well for internal apps.
- Implement a **custom user verifier** for production. This is required for multi-user apps and agents, as it doesn't require your users to sign in to Arcade.dev and lets you fully control the design of the auth flow.

You can configure this setting in the [Auth > Settings section](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/settings) of the Arcade Dashboard.
