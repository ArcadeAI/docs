# Configure an OAuth provider

Learn how to configure OAuth providers for your user-facing agents to enable secure authentication with external services.

## Overview

When building user-facing agents, you need to configure OAuth providers to allow your users to securely connect their accounts with third-party services. This enables your agents to perform actions on behalf of your users while maintaining proper authorization and security.

## Key Concepts

- **OAuth Provider Configuration**: Set up the connection between your application and external services
- **User Consent**: Enable users to grant permissions to your agents
- **Token Management**: Handle access tokens and refresh tokens securely
- **Scope Management**: Request appropriate permissions for your use case

## Getting Started

Configure OAuth providers through the Arcade Dashboard or programmatically via the Arcade API to enable your agents to access external services with user authorization.

## Next Steps

- Set up your first OAuth provider in the Dashboard
- Configure user consent flows
- Test the authentication process
- Deploy your user-facing agent
