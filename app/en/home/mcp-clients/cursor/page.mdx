# Use Arcade in Cursor

In this guide, you'll learn how to connect Cursor to an Arcade MCP Gateway.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

1. Create an <SignupLink linkLocation="docs:claude-desktop-client">Arcade account</SignupLink>
2. Get an [Arcade API key](/home/api-keys)
3. Create an [Arcade MCP Gateway](/home/mcp-gateways) and select the tools you want to use

### Set up Cursor

3. Download and open [Cursor](https://cursor.com/download)
4. Open the command palette and select **Open MCP Settings...**
5. Choose **HTTP**
6. Paste the URL of your MCP Gateway
7. Give your MCP server a name, like `mcp-arcade`
8. Add the API key as the bearer token within the `Authorization` header, and the email address that you used to sign up for the Arcade account as the `Arcade-User-ID` header

Cursor will update your `settings.json` file with the following

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-arcade": {
      "url": "https://api.arcade.dev/mcp/<YOUR-GATEWAY-SLUG>",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {arcade_api_key}",
        "Arcade-User-ID": "{arcade_user_id}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Try it out

1. Open the chat pane (typically command-l)
1. Make sure you are in **Agent** mode
1. Ask the agent to use a tool!
