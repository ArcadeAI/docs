# Use Arcade tools in Cursor

Connect Cursor to Arcade and give your AI coding assistant access to powerful tools like GitHub, Linear, Slack, Google Drive, and more.

With this integration, you can ask Cursor's agent to:
- Create GitHub issues and pull requests
- Search and update Linear tickets
- Send Slack messages
- Read and write Google Docs
- And much more

<Steps>

### Get your Arcade credentials

1. <SignupLink linkLocation="docs:cursor-mcp-client">Create an Arcade account</SignupLink> if you don't have one
2. Get an [Arcade API key](/home/api-keys)
3. Create an [Arcade MCP Gateway](/home/mcp-gateways) and select the tools you want to use in Cursor

<Callout type="info">
Save your MCP Gateway URL—you'll need it in the next step. It looks like: `https://api.arcade.dev/mcp/your-gateway-slug`
</Callout>

### Configure Cursor

1. Open [Cursor](https://cursor.com/download) (version 0.50 or higher)
2. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
3. Type **MCP** and select **Open MCP Settings...**
4. Select **HTTP** as the server type
5. Paste your MCP Gateway URL
6. Name your server (e.g., `arcade`)
7. Add your authentication headers:
   - `Authorization`: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
   - `Arcade-User-ID`: Your Arcade account email

Cursor updates your `settings.json` file. The configuration looks like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arcade": {
      "url": "https://api.arcade.dev/mcp/your-gateway-slug",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key",
        "Arcade-User-ID": "you@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Start using tools

1. Open the chat pane (`Cmd+L` on Mac, `Ctrl+L` on Windows/Linux)
2. Switch to **Agent** mode using the dropdown at the bottom of the chat
3. Ask the agent to use a tool!

Try these example prompts:
- "List my open GitHub issues"
- "Create a Linear ticket for this bug"
- "Send a Slack message to #general"

</Steps>

## Authorize tools

Some tools require you to authorize access to your accounts (like GitHub or Google). When you use a tool for the first time, Arcade prompts you to authorize. Click the link and follow the OAuth flow—you only need to do this once per service.

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">
**Tools not appearing?** Make sure you're in **Agent** mode, not Ask or Edit mode. Only Agent mode can use MCP tools.
</Callout>

**Common issues:**

- **"Server not connected"**: Check that your MCP Gateway URL is correct and your API key is valid
- **"Unauthorized" errors**: Verify your `Authorization` header includes `Bearer ` before your API key
- **Tools not working**: Ensure the tool is enabled in your [MCP Gateway configuration](/home/mcp-gateways)

## Next steps

- Browse available [MCP Servers](/mcp-servers) to add more tools
- Learn about [MCP Gateways](/home/mcp-gateways) to customize your tool selection
- Build your own [custom MCP Server](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server)
