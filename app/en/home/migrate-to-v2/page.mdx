  If your project does not have its dependency on `arcade-ai` pinned to the v1 major version, you must pin it to the v1 major version immediately to prevent potential breakages.

## Release Timeline
Version 2.0.0 of the Arcade CLI was released on **Tuesday, June 17th**. Make sure to pin your project's dependency on `arcade-ai` to the v1 major version before this date to avoid any disruptions.

## Package Changes
With the release of version 2.0.0, the [arcade-ai PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/arcade-ai/) has been divided into three distinct packages. Previously, `arcade-ai` was a monolithic package that included:
- Tool Development Kit (TDK)
- Core execution engine and catalog functionality
- FastAPI/MCP server/worker components
- CLI functionality
- Evaluation framework

Now, the `arcade-ai` package serves as Arcade.dev's CLI, allowing you to create 'starter' toolkits, serve and deploy toolkits, chat, and more via the command line. Also, two new packages have been introduced: `arcade-serve` and `arcade-tdk`. This means faster build times, lighter dependencies, and better performance.

## Package Overview
- **arcade-ai**:
  - To get [the CLI](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/arcade-cli), install via: `pip install arcade-ai`
  - To get [the evaluation framework](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/evaluation-framework), install via: `pip install 'arcade-ai[evals]'`
  - To get everything including the TDK and Serve, install via: `pip install 'arcade-ai[all]'`

- **arcade-tdk**:
  - If you're [writing your own](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) Arcade tools/toolkits.
  - Install via: `pip install arcade-tdk`

- **arcade-serve**:
  - If you're [writing your own](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/modal-worker) custom worker.
  - Install via: `pip install arcade-serve`

## Code Migration Steps
Migrating from v1 to v2 is straightforward with a few find-and-replace actions:
1. Replace all occurrences of `arcade.sdk.eval` with `arcade_evals`.
2. Replace all remaining occurrences of `arcade.sdk` with `arcade_tdk`.
3. Replace all occurrences of `arcade.worker` with `arcade_serve`.
4. Remove your project's required dependency on `arcade-ai`.
5. Add `arcade_tdk>=2.0.0,<3.0.0` as a required dependency if you replaced `arcade.sdk` with `arcade_tdk` in step 2.
6. Add `arcade-ai[evals]>=2.0.0,<3.0.0` as an optional dev dependency if you use the evaluation framework or the CLI.
7. Add `arcade-serve>=2.0.0,<3.0.0` as an optional dev dependency if you use the `arcade serve` CLI command.
