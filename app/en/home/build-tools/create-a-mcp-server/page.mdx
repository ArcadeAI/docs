# Creating an MCP Server with Arcade

The `arcade_mcp_server` package provides powerful ways to run MCP servers with your Arcade tools. This guide walks you through the complete process of creating a custom MCP server with Arcade.

<GuideOverview>
<GuideOverview.Outcomes>

Build and run an MCP server with tools that you define.

<GuideOverview.Prerequisites>

- For this guide, we'll use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as our package manager.

</GuideOverview.Prerequisites>

<GuideOverview.YouWillLearn>

- How to run MCP servers with Arcade tools using the [`arcade_mcp_server`](https://python.mcp.arcade.dev/api/server/server/) package
- How to use `arcade new` from the `arcade-mcp` CLI to create your server project with all necessary files and dependencies.
- How to run your local MCP Server with the Arcade CLI and register it with the Arcade Engine so that your agent can find and use your tool.

<Steps>

## Install the Arcade CLI

In your terminal, run the following command to install the `arcade-mcp` package:

```bash
uv tool install arcade-mcp
```

This package includes the CLI tools and the `arcade-mcp-server` library.

## Create Your Server

In your terminal, run the following command to scaffold a new MCP Server called `my_server`:

```bash
arcade new my_server
cd my_server
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you aren't already logged into your Arcade account, you will be prompted to
  do so by running `arcade login` in your terminal.
</Callout>

This generates a complete project with:

- **server.py** Main server file with MCPApp and example tools
- **pyproject.toml** Dependencies and project configuration
- **.env.example** Example `.env` file containing a secret required by one of the generated tools in `server.py`. Environments are loaded on server start, so **if you update the `.env` file, you will need to restart your server.**

`server.py` includes proper structure with command-line argument handling. It creates an `MCPApp`, defines tools with `@app.tool`, and runs with `app.run()`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""my_server MCP server"""

import sys
from typing import Annotated

import httpx
from arcade_mcp_server import Context, MCPApp
from arcade_mcp_server.auth import Reddit

# Create an MCPApp instance
app = MCPApp(name="my_server", version="1.0.0", log_level="DEBUG")

# Add a tool
@app.tool
def greet(name: Annotated[str, "The name of the person to greet"]) -> str:
    """Greet a person by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# ... more tools ...

# Run with specific transport
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Get transport from command line argument, default to "http"
    transport = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "http"

    # Run the server
    # - "http" (default): HTTPS streaming for Cursor, VS Code, etc.
    # - "stdio": Standard I/O for Claude Desktop, CLI tools, etc.
    app.run(transport=transport, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

## Run your MCP Server

Run your MCP Server using one of the with the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

You should see output like this in your terminal:

```bash
INFO | Starting server v1.0.0 (my_server)
INFO | Added tool: greet
INFO | Starting MCP server on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Configure your MCP Client(s)

Now you can connect your MCP server to apps that support MCP Clients, like AI assistants and IDEs. :

<Tabs
  items={["Claude Desktop", "Cursor IDE", "VS Code"]}
  storageKey="preferredAgent"
>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure claude --from-local
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure cursor --from-local
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure vscode --from-local
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

That's it! Your MCP server is running and connected to your AI assistant.

</Steps>

## Key takeaways

- **Minimal Setup** Create `MCPApp`, define tools with `@app.tool`, and run with `app.run()`
- **Direct Execution** Run your server file directly with `uv run` or `python`
- **Transport Flexibility** Works with both stdio (for Claude Desktop) and HTTP
- **Type Annotations** Use `Annotated` to provide descriptions to the language model for parameters and return values
- **Command Line Arguments** Pass transport type as command line argument
