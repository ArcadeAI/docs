# Understanding ToolContext

`ToolContext` is a component in Arcade that manages authorization and user information for tools requiring authentication. `ToolContext` is a class that holds two main pieces of information:

- **Authorization context** This includes a token for making authenticated requests to external APIs as well as structured user information for providers that support retrieving user information.
- **User ID** This identifies the user invoking the tool.

<Note>
  Some authorization providers may also include additional structured user
  information in the `ToolContext`.
</Note>

## How `ToolContext` Works

When you invoke a tool that requires authorization, Arcade's Tool SDK automatically:

1. Creates a `ToolContext` object
2. Passes this object to your tool

You can then use the `ToolContext` object to make authenticated requests to external APIs.
