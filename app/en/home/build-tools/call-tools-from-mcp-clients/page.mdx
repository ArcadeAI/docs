# Call tools from MCP clients

In this guide, you'll learn how to call tools from MCP clients.

<Steps>
## Create an MCP Server

If you haven't already, create an [MCP Server](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server)

## Run the MCP Server

From the root directory of your MCP Server, run the following command:

<Tabs
  items={["stdio transport (default)", "http transport"]}
  storageKey="preferredTransport"
>
<Tabs.Tab>

```bash
uv run server.py stdio
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```bash
uv run server.py http
```

For HTTP transport, view your server's API docs at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

You should see output like this in your terminal:

```bash
INFO | Starting server v1.0.0 (my_server)
INFO | Added tool: greet
INFO | Starting MCP server on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Configure your MCP Client(s)

Now you can connect your MCP server to apps that support MCP Clients, like AI assistants and IDEs. :

<Tabs
  items={["Cursor IDE", "VS Code", "Claude Desktop", "Other MCP Clients"]}
  storageKey="preferredAgent"
>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure cursor --from-local
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure vscode --from-local
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure claude --from-local
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    If your MCP client is not supported by the `arcade configure` command, you can manually add the MCP server to your client's configuration file. First, determine the transport type.

    <Tabs
      items={["stdio (default)", "Streamable HTTP"]}
    >
    <Tabs.Tab>

    When configuring your MCP client using the stdio transport, you need to ensure that the MCP server is called using the right version of python and within the correct working directory. For example, let's pretend this is your setup:

    - Your virtual environment is located at `/path/to/your/project/.venv`
    - Your project is located at `/path/to/your/project`
    - The entrypoint to your MCP server is `server.py`
    - One of your tools requires the `MY_SECRET_KEY` environment variable to be set.

    Then, your MCP client's configuration file should look like this:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "my_server": {
          "command": "/path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/python",
          "args": ["/path/to/your/project/server.py", "stdio"],
          "env": {
            "MY_SECRET_KEY": "my-secret-value"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This will ensure that the command used by the MCP client to start the MCP server is the correct version of python and that the environment variables are set correctly.
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>

    When configuring your MCP client using the http transport, ensure the MCP server is started on the correct port and from the correct working directory. For example, if your setup is:

    - Your virtual environment is located at `/path/to/your/project/.venv`
    - Your MCP server is located at `/path/to/your/project/server.py`
    - Your secrets are stored in the `.env` file

    Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source /path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/activate
    ```

    run the MCP server using the http transport. The secrets will be loaded from the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    uv run server.py http
    ```

    Then, your MCP client's configuration file should look like this:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "my_server": {
          "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
          "transport": "http"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
      For security reasons, Local HTTP servers do not currently support managed
      authorization and secrets. If you need to use authorization or secrets, you
      should use the stdio transport and configure the Arcade API key and secrets in
      your MCP connection settings. If you intend to expose your HTTP MCP server to
      the public internet, please follow the [on-prem MCP server](/home/deployment/on-prem-mcp)
      guide for secure remote deployment.
