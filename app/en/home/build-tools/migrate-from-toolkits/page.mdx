# Migrate from toolkits to MCP servers

This guide helps you migrate your existing Arcade toolkit to the new MCP Server framework. The `arcade-tdk` package has been deprecated in favor of `arcade-mcp-server`, and the `arcade-ai` CLI has been replaced by `arcade-mcp`.

  Server](/home/build-tools/create-a-mcp-server) guide instead.

</Callout>

## Understanding the changes

Before migrating, it's helpful to understand what has changed:

### Terminology updates

- **Workers** are now called **servers** or **MCP servers**
- **Toolkits** are now called **servers**, **MCP servers**, or **tools** depending on the context

### Package changes

- **arcade-ai** (old CLI) → **arcade-mcp** (new CLI)
- **arcade-tdk** (old tool development kit) → **arcade-mcp-server** (new MCP Server framework)

The new `arcade-mcp-server` framework should feel familiar if you've used `arcade-tdk`, but there are important differences to be aware of.

<Steps>

## Update your dependencies

Open your `pyproject.toml` file and update the dependencies:

### Replace the main dependency

Replace `arcade-tdk` with `arcade-mcp-server`:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "arcade-mcp-server>=1.4.0,<2.0.0",
    # ... other dependencies
]
```

### Update development dependencies

If your toolkit used `arcade-ai` or `arcade-serve` as development dependencies, replace them with `arcade-mcp[all]`:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "arcade-mcp[all]>=1.3.0,<2.0.0",
    # ... other dev dependencies
]
```

### Install the updated dependencies

Run the following command to install the updated dependencies and development dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

## Update your imports

Replace all imports from `arcade-tdk` with imports from `arcade-mcp-server`. Most import paths have remained the same or have only slight variations:

### Auth imports

```python
# Before
from arcade_tdk.auth import Google

# After
from arcade_mcp_server.auth import Google
```

### Tool decorator

```python
# Before
from arcade_tdk import tool

# After
from arcade_mcp_server import tool
```

### Error handling

```python
# Before
from arcade_tdk.errors import ToolExecutionError

# After
from arcade_mcp_server.exceptions import ToolExecutionError
```

### Context object

Replace `ToolContext` with `Context`:

```python
# Before
from arcade_tdk import ToolContext

@tool
def my_tool(context: ToolContext) -> str:
    """My tool that uses context"""
    return "Hello"

# After
from arcade_mcp_server import Context

@tool
def my_tool(context: Context) -> str:
    """My tool that uses context"""
    return "Hello"
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The `ToolContext` class is no longer used. Make sure to replace all instances
  of `ToolContext` with `Context` in your tool functions.
</Callout>

## Create an entrypoint file

Previously, you would run your toolkit using the `arcade serve` CLI command. Now, you need to create an entrypoint file that runs your MCP server. This allows you to define your own startup and teardown logic for your MCP server.

An entrypoint file is a Python file that creates and runs an `MCPApp` when invoked. `MCPApp` is the developer-facing API for creating and managing your MCP server.

### Option 1: Use the tool decorator

You can register tools directly on the app using the `@app.tool` decorator:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""My MCP Server"""

import sys
from arcade_mcp_server import MCPApp

app = MCPApp(name="my_server", version="1.0.0")

@app.tool
def echo_hello() -> str:
    """Tool that just says hello"""
    return "Hello"

@app.tool
def echo_goodbye() -> str:
    """Tool that just says goodbye"""
    return "Goodbye"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    transport = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "http"
    app.run(transport=transport)
```

### Option 2: Register tools explicitly

You can also use the standalone `@tool` decorator and register tools explicitly:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""My MCP Server"""

import sys
from arcade_mcp_server import MCPApp, tool

@tool
def echo_hello() -> str:
    """Tool that just says hello"""
    return "Hello"

@tool
def echo_goodbye() -> str:
    """Tool that just says goodbye"""
    return "Goodbye"

app = MCPApp(name="my_server", version="1.0.0")
app.add_tool(echo_hello)
app.add_tool(echo_goodbye)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    transport = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "http"
    app.run(transport=transport)
```

### Option 3: Register tools from modules

If your old toolkit had many tools, you may want to use the `add_tools_from_module` method to register all your tools at once:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""My MCP Server"""

import sys
import my_module_with_tools

from arcade_mcp_server import MCPApp

app = MCPApp(name="my_server", version="1.0.0")
app.add_tools_from_module(my_module_with_tools)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    transport = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "http"
    app.run(transport=transport)
```

<Callout type="info">
  For large toolkits with many tools, using `add_tools_from_module` is the
  recommended approach. This keeps your entrypoint file clean and maintainable.
</Callout>

## Run your MCP server

Replace the old `arcade serve` command with direct execution of your entrypoint file:

```bash
# Before
arcade serve

# After
uv run server.py
```

You can specify the transport type as a command line argument:

```bash
# Run with HTTP transport (default)
uv run server.py http

# Run with stdio transport
uv run server.py stdio
```

## Update deployment configuration

The `arcade deploy` command still exists for deploying MCP servers, but the deployment process has been simplified.

### Before (with toolkits)

Previously, you would deploy your toolkit using:

```bash
arcade deploy
```

And configure your deployment with a `worker.toml` file.

### After (with MCP servers)

You still use `arcade deploy`, but you no longer need a `worker.toml` file:

```bash
arcade deploy
```

The deployment configuration is now inferred from your `MCPApp` and project structure.

<Callout type="info">
  You're no longer deploying a "worker"—you're deploying an MCP server. The
  deployment process has been streamlined to require less configuration.
</Callout>

</Steps>

| `from arcade_tdk.errors import ToolExecutionError` | `from arcade_mcp_server.exceptions import ToolExecutionError` |
| `worker.toml`                                      | Not needed                                                    |

## Next steps

After migrating your toolkit to an MCP server:

- **Test your server**: Run your server locally and verify all tools work correctly
- **Update your CI/CD**: Update any automated workflows to use the new CLI and commands
- **Deploy your server**: Use `arcade deploy` to deploy your MCP server
- **Configure MCP clients**: Connect your server to [MCP clients](/home/build-tools/call-tools-from-mcp-clients) like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or VS Code
