# Custom MCP server Quickstart

<strong>Build AI agents that actually take action.</strong>

Most AI apps are stuck in read-only mode. Arcade gives your AI the power to act â€” send Gmail, update Notion, message in Slack, and more.

In this quickstart, you'll:

- Install the Arcade MCP Framework
- Start your MCP server and connect to it from your favorite MCP client
- Call a simple tool
- Call a tool that requires a secret
- Create an Arcade account
- Call a tool that requires authentication

Ready to start? Follow the Quickstart below.

<Steps>

## Install the Arcade CLI

In your terminal, run the following command to install the `arcade-mcp` package:

```bash
uv pip install arcade-mcp
```

This package includes the CLI tools and the `arcade-mcp-server` library.

## Create Your Server

In your terminal, run the following command to scaffold a new MCP Server called `my_server`:

```bash
arcade new my_server
cd my_server
```

This generates a complete project with:

- **server.py** Main server file with MCPApp and example tools
- **pyproject.toml** Dependencies and project configuration
- **.env.example** Example `.env` file containing a secret required by one of the generated tools in `server.py`

`server.py` includes proper structure with command-line argument handling. It creates an `MCPApp` with three sample tools:

- **`greet`**: This tool has a single argument, the name of the person to greet. It requires no secrets or auth
- **`whisper_secret`**: This tool requires no arguments, and will output the last 4 characters of a `MY_SECRET_KEY` secret.
- **`get_posts_in_subreddit`**: This tool has a single argument, a subreddit, and will return the latest posts on that subreddit, it requires the user to authenticate their reddit account.

## Setup the secrets in your environment

Secrets can be provided via environment variables.

You can set the environment variable in your terminal like so:

```bash
export SECRET_KEY="my-secret-value"
```

Or you can create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your secret:

```env filename=".env"
SECRET_KEY="my-secret-value"
```

## Connect to Arcade to enable authenticated tool calling

The reddit tool requires auth. For this you need to create an Arcade account and connect to it from the terminal, run:

```bash
arcade login
```

Follow the instructions in your browser, and once you've finished, your terminal will be connected to your Arcade account.

## Run your MCP Server

Run your MCP Server using one of the with the following commands in your terminal:

<Tabs
  items={["HTTP transport (default)", "stdio transport (for Claude Desktop)"]}
  storageKey="preferredTransport"
>

<Tabs.Tab>

```bash
uv run server.py http
```

For HTTP transport, view your server's API docs at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```bash
uv run server.py stdio
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

You should see output like this in your terminal:

```bash
INFO | Starting server v1.0.0 (my_server)
INFO | Added tool: greet
INFO | Starting MCP server on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Configure your MCP Client(s)

Now you can connect your MCP server to apps that support MCP Clients, like AI assistants and IDEs. :

<Tabs
  items={["Claude Desktop", "Cursor IDE", "VS Code"]}
  storageKey="preferredAgent"
>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure claude --from-local
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure cursor --from-local
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure vscode --from-local
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

That's it! Your MCP server is running and connected to your AI assistant.
