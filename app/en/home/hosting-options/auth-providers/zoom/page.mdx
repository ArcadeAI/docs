# Zoom auth provider

<Callout type="info">
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Zoom Auth Provider. To use Zoom
  auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Zoom OAuth 2.0
  credentials as described below.
</Callout>

The Zoom auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Zoom API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Zoom auth provider seamlessly manage Zoom OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Zoom auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-zoom-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Zoom APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-zoom-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Zoom APIs

## Configuring Zoom auth

<Callout type="info">
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to
  use a [custom user
  verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier).
  Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in
  production.
</Callout>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Zoom app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Zoom credentials in both the Arcade Cloud Platform or in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Zoom app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Zoom app.

### Create a Zoom app

- Follow Zoom's guide to [registering an app](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/create/) on the Zoom marketplace
- Set the redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below) and enable Strict Mode
- Enable the Zoom features and permissions (scopes) that your app needs
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Zoom app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Zoom Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Zoom app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure Zoom Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Zoom**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-zoom-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Zoom app.
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Zoom app's redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Zoom auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Zoom OAuth provider. If you have multiple Zoom providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Zoom auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Callout>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more
  information on how to set environment variables and configure the Arcade
  Engine.
</Callout>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `zoom` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml {3-9}
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-zoom
      description: "The default Zoom provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: zoom
      client_id: ${env:ZOOM_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

</Steps>

</Tabs.Tab>

## Using Zoom auth in app code

Use the Zoom auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Zoom API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Zoom API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python {8-12}
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="zoom",
    scopes=["meeting:read:list_upcoming_meetings"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript {8-10}
import { Arcade } from '@arcadeai/arcadejs';

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = '{arcade_user_id}';

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, 'zoom', [
  'meeting:read:list_upcoming_meetings',
]);

if (authResponse.status !== 'completed') {
  console.log('Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:');
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Zoom auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Zoom API.

Use the `Zoom()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Zoom. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Zoom token:

```python {5-6,9-13,23}
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Zoom


@tool(
    requires_auth=Zoom(
        scopes=["meeting:read:list_upcoming_meetings"],
    )
)
async def list_upcoming_meetings(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_id: Annotated[
        Optional[str],
        "The user's user ID or email address. Defaults to 'me' for the current user.",
    ] = "me",
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of upcoming meetings within the next 24 hours"]:
    """List a Zoom user's upcoming meetings within the next 24 hours."""
    url = f"https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/{user_id}/upcoming_meetings"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
