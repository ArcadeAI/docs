# Docker Installation

## Engine

### Pulling the Engine Image

The Arcade Engine is stateless and the docker image is designed to scale horizontally for production environments.

The docker image for the engine can be pulled with

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/arcadeai/engine:latest
```

### Running the Engine

The engine can be run with:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9099:9099 -v ./engine.yaml:/bin/engine.yaml ghcr.io/arcadeai/engine:latest
```

where config.yaml is the path to the [configuration file](/home/hosting-options/local-deployment/configure/templates).

## Worker

Arcade now provides a base Worker image that you can use to build your custom Worker image. Follow the [Build custom worker images with docker](/home/authoring-tools/serve-tools/docker-worker) guide to create your own Worker image using Arcade's base Worker image.
