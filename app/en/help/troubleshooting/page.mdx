# Troubleshooting

Quick solutions to common Arcade issues.

## Authentication Issues

### "User not authorized" error

**Problem:** Tool call fails with authorization error.

**Solution:**
1. Check if the user has completed OAuth for the service
2. Verify you're passing the correct `user_id`
3. Check auth status before calling tools:

```python
status = client.auth.status(tool_name="Google.SendEmail", user_id="user_123")
if status.status == "not_authorized":
    # Redirect to status.authorization_url
```

### OAuth popup doesn't appear

**Problem:** User clicks authorize but nothing happens.

**Solutions:**
- Check browser popup blocker settings
- Ensure the authorization URL is opened in a new window/tab
- Verify your OAuth redirect URI is correctly configured

### Token expired errors

**Problem:** Previously working tools now fail with token errors.

**Solution:** Arcade handles token refresh automatically. If you're seeing this:
1. The refresh token may have been revoked by the user
2. Have the user re-authorize the service

## Tool Calling Issues

### "Tool not found" error

**Problem:** Tool execution fails because the tool doesn't exist.

**Solutions:**
1. Check the tool name is spelled correctly (case-sensitive)
2. Verify the tool is available in your plan
3. List available tools: `arcade tools list`

### Tool returns unexpected results

**Problem:** Tool works but returns wrong or incomplete data.

**Solutions:**
1. Check the input parameters match the tool's expected schema
2. Verify the user has the required permissions in the target service
3. Check the [tool documentation](/tool-catalog) for specific requirements

### Tool call timeout

**Problem:** Tool execution takes too long and times out.

**Solutions:**
1. Some operations (like large file uploads) may take longer
2. Increase timeout in your client configuration
3. For batch operations, consider breaking into smaller chunks

## MCP Server Issues (Custom Tools)

### Server won't start

**Problem:** `arcade dev` fails to start your server.

**Solutions:**
1. Check Python version (requires 3.10+)
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Check for syntax errors in your tool code

### Tools not appearing in the server

**Problem:** Server starts but your tools aren't registered.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure tools use the `@tool` decorator
2. Check that tool functions are imported correctly
3. Verify tool docstrings are properly formatted
