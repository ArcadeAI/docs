# Arcade with OpenAI Agents

Arcade provides seamless integration with the [OpenAI Agents Library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) and [OpenAI Agents JS](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/), allowing you to enhance your AI agents with powerful tools including Gmail, LinkedIn, GitHub, and many more. This integration is available through the `agents-arcade` package for Python and our [JavaScript client library](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-js).

## Installation

Install the necessary packages to get started:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```bash
pip install agents-arcade arcadepy
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```bash
npm install @openai/agents @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

Make sure you have your Arcade API key ready. [Get an API key](/get-started/setup/api-key) if you don't already have one.

## Key features

- **Easy integration** with the OpenAI Agents framework
- **Access to all Arcade MCP Servers** including Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, X, and more
- **Create custom tools** with the Arcade Tool SDK
- **Manage user authentication** for tools that require it
- **Asynchronous support** compatible with OpenAI's Agent framework

## Basic usage

Here's a simple example of using Arcade tools with OpenAI Agents:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError

async def main():
    # Initialize the Arcade client
    client = AsyncArcade()

    # Get tools from the "gmail" MCP Server
    tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["gmail"])

    # Create an agent with Gmail tools
    google_agent = Agent(
        name="Gmail agent",
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Gmail API calls.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=tools,
    )

    try:
        # Run the agent with a unique user_id for authorization
        result = await Runner.run(
            starting_agent=google_agent,
            input="What are my latest emails?",
            context={"user_id": "{arcade_user_id}"},
        )
        print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
    except AuthorizationError as e:
        print("Please Login to Google:", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

Check out the complete working example in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/tree/main/examples/openai-agents-ts/src/index.ts).

```javascript
import Arcade from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";
import { executeOrAuthorizeZodTool, toZod } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";
import { Agent, run, tool } from "@openai/agents";

// 1) Initialize Arcade client
const client = new Arcade();

// 2) Fetch Gmail MCP Server from Arcade and prepare tools for OpenAI Agents
const googleToolkit = await client.tools.list({ toolkit: "gmail", limit: 30 });
const tools = toZod({
  tools: googleToolkit.items,
  client,
  userId: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID>", // Replace this with your application's user ID (e.g. email address, UUID, etc.)
  executeFactory: executeOrAuthorizeZodTool,
}).map(tool);

// 3) Create a new agent with the Gmail MCP Server
const googleAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Gmail agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Google API calls.",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  tools,
});

// 4) Run the agent
const result = await run(googleAgent, "What are my latest emails?");

// 5) Print the result
console.log(result.finalOutput);
```

</Tabs.Tab>

## Handling authorization

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

When a user needs to authorize access to a tool (like Google or GitHub), the agent will raise an `AuthorizationError` with a URL for the user to visit:

```python
try:
    # Run agent code
    # ...
except AuthorizationError as e:
    # Display the authorization URL to the user
    print(f"Please visit this URL to authorize: {e}")
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

When a user needs to authorize access to a tool (like Google or GitHub), the agent will show a message like this:

```bash
[Authorize Gmail Access](https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?access_type=offline...)
Once you have authorized access, I can retrieve your latest emails.
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

After visiting the URL and authorizing access, the user can run the agent again with the same `user_id`, and it will work without requiring re-authorization.

## Available MCP Servers

Arcade provides a variety of MCP Servers you can use with your agents:

- **Google Suite**: Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs
- **Social Media**: LinkedIn, X
- **Development**: GitHub
- **Web**: Web search, content extraction
- **And more**: Weather, financial data, etc.

For a full list of available MCP Servers, visit the [Arcade MCP Servers](/resources/integrations) documentation.
