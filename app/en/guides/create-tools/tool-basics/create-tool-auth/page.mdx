</GuideOverview>

An auth provider is the service that issues and manages the OAuth token your tool uses. It is the identity “source of truth” your tool integrates with to request permissions and obtain OAuth tokens.

When you create a tool with `requires_auth`, you specify which provider to use. In this example, **`arcade_mcp_server.auth.Reddit` specifies the Reddit auth provider.**

## How auth providers work during execution

1. When the tool is invoked, Arcade checks if the user has already authorized the scopes required by the tool.
2. If the tool's requirements are not met, Arcade initiates the provider-specific OAuth flow for the requested scopes.
    > 2a). The user is presented with a URL to complete the OAuth challenge. The user will need to visit this URL and log in and explicitly grant consent for the action to be performed on their behalf. This is the "OAuth challenge".

    > 2b). The provider issues the token, and Arcade will securely inject it into the tool's [`Context`](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/runtime-data-access) on its next invocation. The client and the LLM will never see the token.

    > 2c). The tool needs to be re-invoked - this time its requirements will be met.
3. The tool is executed, and uses the token injected into its `Context` to call the provider's API (e.g., `https://oauth.reddit.com`), without the LLM or client ever seeing the token.

The auth provider defines where the identity lives, what permissions are available (scopes), and how tokens are issued and refreshed. In code, it's the class you pass to `requires_auth` (e.g., `Reddit(scopes=["read"])`) that encodes the OAuth details for that service.

## Add user authorization to your MCP tools

<Steps>

### Import the necessary modules

Create a new Python file, e.g., `auth_tools.py`, and import the necessary modules and classes:

```python showLineNumbers filename="auth_tools.py"
import sys
from typing import Annotated

import httpx
from arcade_mcp_server import Context, MCPApp
from arcade_mcp_server.auth import Reddit
```

### Create the MCP Server

Create an instance of the `MCPApp` class:

```python filename="auth_tools.py"
app = MCPApp(name="auth_example", version="1.0.0", log_level="DEBUG")
```

### Define your MCP tool

Now, define your tool using the `@app.tool` decorator and specify the required authorization, in this case, by using [Arcade's Reddit auth provider](/references/auth-providers/reddit).

Specifying the `requires_auth` parameter in the `@app.tool` decorator indicates that the tool needs user authorization. In this example, we're using the `Reddit` auth provider with the `read` scope:

```python showLineNumbers filename="auth_tools.py" {1-5} {16}
@app.tool(
  requires_auth=Reddit(
    scopes=["read"]
   )
)
async def get_posts_in_subreddit(
    context: Context, subreddit: Annotated[str, "The name of the subreddit"]
) -> dict:
    """Get posts from a specific subreddit"""
    # Normalize the subreddit name
    subreddit = subreddit.lower().replace("r/", "").replace(" ", "")

    # Prepare the httpx request
    # OAuth token is injected into the context at runtime.
    # LLMs and MCP clients cannot see or access your OAuth tokens.
    oauth_token = context.get_auth_token_or_empty()
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {oauth_token}",
        "User-Agent": "mcp_server-mcp-server",
    }
    params = {"limit": 5}
    url = f"https://oauth.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}/hot"

    # Make the request
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()

        # Return the response
        return response.json()
```

<Callout type="warning">

To use this tool, you need to install the Arcade CLI and run 'arcade login' to authenticate:

```bash
uv tool install arcade-mcp
arcade login
```

</Callout>

Arcade offers a number of [built-in auth providers](/references/auth-providers/), including Slack, Google, and GitHub. You can also require authorization with a custom auth provider, using the `OAuth2` class, a subclass of the `ToolAuthorization` class:

```python
@app.tool(
  requires_auth=OAuth2(
    id="your-oauth-provider-id",
    scopes=["scope1", "scope2"],
  )
)
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The `OAuth2` class requires an `id` parameter to identify the auth provider in
  the Arcade Engine. For built-in providers like `Slack`, you can skip the `id`.
  The Arcade Engine will find the right provider using your credentials. While
  you can specify an `id` for built-in providers, only do this for private tools
  that won't be shared.
</Callout>

### Specify OAuth scopes

Specify the OAuth scopes you need for your tool. In this example, you already are using the `read` scope, but you can specify multiple scopes for more permissions (like `identity`):

```python showLineNumbers filename="auth_tools.py" {2}
# Multiple scopes for more permissions
@app.tool(requires_auth=Reddit(scopes=["read", "identity"]))
async def identity_tool(context: Context) -> dict:
    """Tool that accesses user identity."""
    pass
```

<Callout type="warning">
Scopes are defined by the auth provider, and they vary between providers. Each service exposes its own set of scopes that determine what your tools can access. You'll need to review the provider's documentation to see which scopes are available and what permissions each one grants.
</Callout>

### Run the MCP Server

```python showLineNumbers filename="auth_tools.py"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Get transport from command line argument, default to "stdio"
    transport = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "stdio"

    print(f"Starting auth example server with {transport} transport")
    print("Prerequisites:")
    print("  1. Install: uv tool install arcade-mcp")
    print("  2. Login: arcade login\n")

    # Run the server
    # - "stdio" (default): Standard I/O transport
    # - "http": HTTP streamable transport
    app.run(transport=transport, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

Verify your MCP Server can run successfully by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
uv run auth_tools.py stdio
```

## Configure your MCP Client(s)

Now you can connect your MCP server to apps that support MCP Clients, like AI assistants and IDEs. :

<Tabs
  items={["Claude Desktop", "Cursor IDE", "VS Code"]}
  storageKey="preferredAgent"
>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure claude
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure cursor
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash
    arcade configure vscode
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Now restart your MCP Client and try calling your tool.

### Handle authorization

Since the tool requires authorization, the first time a user uses it, the user will go through an OAuth flow to authorize the tool to act on their behalf. Once the user has completed the OAuth flow, the tool will need to be re-invoked. See the [how auth providers work during execution](#how-auth-providers-work-during-execution) section for more details.

</Steps>

## How it works

Arcade manages the OAuth flow, and provides the token via `context.get_auth_token_or_empty()`. Arcade also remembers the user's authorization tokens, so they won't have to go through the authorization process again until the token is revoked by the user.

### Accessing OAuth tokens

To get the authorization token, use the `context.get_auth_token_or_empty()` method.

```python filename="auth_tools.py"
# Get the token (returns empty string if not authenticated)
oauth_token = context.get_auth_token_or_empty()

# Use token in API requests
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {oauth_token}",
    "User-Agent": "my-app",
}
```

### Making Authenticated API Requests

Use the OAuth token with httpx or other HTTP clients:

```python filename="auth_tools.py"
import httpx

async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.get(
        "https://oauth.reddit.com/api/endpoint",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {oauth_token}"}
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

## Security Best Practices

- Never log tokens: OAuth tokens should never be logged or exposed
- Use appropriate scopes: Request only the scopes your tool actually needs

## Key takeaways

- **OAuth Support:** Arcade handles OAuth flows and token management
- **Secure Token Injection:** Tokens are injected into context at runtime
- **Scope Management:** Specify exactly which permissions your tool needs
- **Provider Support:** Multiple OAuth providers available out of the box
- **User Privacy:** LLMs and MCP clients never see OAuth tokens

    print(f"Starting auth example server with {transport} transport")
    print("Prerequisites:")
    print("  1. Install: uv tool install arcade-mcp")
    print("  2. Login: arcade login\n")

    # Run the server

    # - "http": HTTP streamable transport
    app.run(transport=transport, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

```
