# Types of Tools

This page explains the two types of tools Arcade offers and how they differ in their design approach.

Arcade offers two types of tools:

- Unoptimized tools
- Optimized tools

The distinction is how Arcade designs them. Both types of tools work seamlessly in the same way. No difference exists in their interfaces, how you call them, or how you interact with them through the Arcade [Dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/) or the Arcade [SDK clients](/references).

Before understanding the two types, first understand the background for why differentiation between them matters.

## Why LLMs perform poorly when calling HTTP APIs

Traditionally, the HTTP APIs offered by upstream services such as GitHub, Google, Slack, etc., developers designed to allow human software engineers to consume them. When these interfaces become available for LLMs to call as tools, they typically do not perform well.

One of the main reasons is that the data model of the HTTP API rarely matches the data model of an AI-powered chat interface.

For instance, consider the following user prompt:

> "Send a DM to John asking about a project update"

The data model mismatches are:

| Dimension | Chat interface                         | Slack HTTP API                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Action    | Send message to a <b><i>person</i></b> | Send message to a <b><i>channel</i></b> |
| Argument  | `username = "John"`                    | `channel_id = ???`                      |

In order to bridge the gap in the data models, the LLM has to make multiple API calls:

1. Retrieve the current user's Slack ID
2. Browse the list of users to find John's ID
3. Open a DM (direct message) channel between the user and John, and get this channel's ID
4. Send the message to the channel

Even the most powerful LLMs typically perform poorly when they need to reason such complex workflows on the fly, not to mention the increased cost and risk of hallucinations. As a result, AI Agents and chatbots that rely on HTTP APIs often end up being unreliable.

## Optimized tools

Arcade's Optimized MCP servers match the typical data models expected in AI-powered chat interfaces, and evaluation suites test them to ensure LLMs can safely use them.

Following the example above, the Slack MCP server offers the [`Slack.SendMessage`](/resources/integrations/social-communication/slack#slacksendmessage) tool, which accepts a `username` as argument, matching exactly both the action and argument value expected to be present in the LLM context window.

When a user says "Send a DM to John asking about a project update", the LLM can directly call the `Slack.SendMessage` tool with the `username` argument, and the tool will take care of the rest.

Optimized tools dramatically improve the speed, reliability and cost-effectiveness of AI Agents and chatbots.

Since they require careful design and evaluation, Optimized tools take time and effort to build. Arcade understands that your Agent or chatbot project might need capabilities not yet covered by Arcade's Optimized MCP servers. For this reason, Arcade also offers low-level Unoptimized MCP servers (formerly known as Starter MCP servers).

## Unoptimized tools

To provide your Agent or chatbot with more freedom to interact with upstream services, Arcade offers Unoptimized MCP servers.

Unoptimized tools heavily reflect the original API design. Each tool mirrors one HTTP endpoint.

Although developers redesign the tool name and argument descriptions to make them more suitable for LLMs, Unoptimized tools are still not optimized for LLM usage. Also, they are not subject to evaluation suites like Optimized tools. For those reasons, you should thoroughly evaluate each Unoptimized tool with your Agents or chatbots before using it in production.

When an Optimized tool covers your Agent's needs, use it instead of an Unoptimized one. Use Unoptimized tools as a complement. Carefully engineer your prompts to ensure your Agent can call them safely.
