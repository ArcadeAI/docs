# Secure and Brand the Auth Flow in Production

To keep your users safe, Arcade.dev performs a user verification check when a tool is authorized for the first time. This check verifies that the user who is authorizing the tool is the same user who started the authorization flow, which helps prevent phishing attacks.

There are two ways to secure your auth flows with Arcade.dev:

- Use the **Arcade user verifier** for development (enabled by default)
- Implement a **custom user verifier** for production

This setting is configured in the [Auth > Settings section](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/settings) of the Arcade Dashboard.

## Use the Arcade user verifier

If you're building a proof-of-concept app or a solo project, use the Arcade user verifier. This option requires no custom development and is on by default when you create a new Arcade.dev account.

This setting is configured in the [Auth > Settings section](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/settings) of the Arcade Dashboard:

  alt="An image showing how to pick the Arcade user verifier option in the Arcade Dashboard"
  className="rounded-sm shadow-md"
  width="600"
/>

When you authorize a tool, you'll be prompted to sign in to your Arcade.dev account. If you are already signed in (to the Arcade Dashboard, for example), this verification will succeed silently.

The Arcade.dev user verifier helps keep your auth flows secure while you are building and testing your agent or app. When you're ready to share your work with others, implement a [custom user verifier](#build-a-custom-user-verifier) so your users don't need to sign in to Arcade.dev.

<Callout type="info">
  Arcade's default OAuth apps can *only* be used with the Arcade user verifier.
  If you are building a multi-user production app, you must obtain your own
  OAuth app credentials and add them to Arcade. For example, see our docs on
  [configuring Google auth in the Arcade
  Dashboard](/references/auth-providers/google#access-the-arcade-dashboard).
</Callout>

## Build a custom user verifier

In a production application or agent, end-users are verified by your code, not Arcade.dev. This allows you to fully control the user experience of the auth flow. To enable this, build a custom verifier route and add the URL to the Arcade Dashboard.

When your users authorize a tool, Arcade.dev will redirect the user's browser to your verifier route with some information in the query string. Your custom verifier route must send a response back to Arcade.dev to confirm the user's ID.

If you need help, join the [Implementing a custom user verifier](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/discussions/486) GitHub discussion and we'll be happy to assist.

<Steps>

### Build a new route

Create a public route in your app or API that can accept a browser redirect (HTTP 303) from Arcade.dev after a user has authorized a tool.

The route must gather the following information:

- The `flow_id` from the current URL's query string
- The unique ID of the user currently signed in, commonly an ID from your application's database, an email address, or similar.

How the user's unique ID is retrieved varies depending on how your app is built, but it is typically retrieved from a session cookie or other secure storage. It **must** match the user ID that your code specified at the start of the authorization flow.

### Verify the user's identity

Use the Arcade SDK (or our REST API) to verify the user's identity.

<Callout type="warning">
  Because this request uses your Arcade API key, it *must not* be made from the
  client side (a browser or desktop app). This code must be run on a server.

**Valid Response**

If the user's ID matches the ID specified at the start of the authorization flow, the response will contain some information about the auth flow. You can either:

- Redirect the user's browser to Arcade's `next_uri`
- Redirect to a different route in your application
- Look up the auth flow's status in the Arcade API and render a success page

// Either redirect to result.next_uri, or another URL, or render a success page:
const authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(result.auth_id);

    status: 303,
    headers: {

### Add your custom verifier route to Arcade

In the [Auth > Settings section](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/settings) of the Arcade Dashboard, pick the **Custom verifier** option and add the URL of your verifier route.
