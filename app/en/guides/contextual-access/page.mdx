# Contextual Access

Agents have broad access to tools, but enterprises need fine-grained control. Arcade's contextual access lets you govern tool visibility and behavior at every stage of execution — who can see a tool, what inputs are allowed, and what comes back.

You connect your own access-control, compliance, or transformation logic to the Arcade Engine. Your rules run inline during tool execution with no changes to your tools or agents required.

## What you can do

- **Control tool visibility** — Decide which tools each user can see based on role, team, entitlement, or any signal from your IDP
- **Validate requests** — Enforce policies before execution (e.g., block certain domains, require org-scoped inputs)
- **Transform payloads** — Enrich inputs, inject secrets, redact PII from outputs, or filter content
- **Audit every interaction** — Route all tool calls through your security and logging infrastructure

## How it works

Contextual access is powered by **Logic Extensions** — webhook servers you deploy that implement a simple contract. The Arcade Engine calls your server at three predefined hook points in the tool lifecycle:

| Hook point | When it runs | What it can do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Access Hook** | When listing tools for a user | Allow or deny tools the user can see |
| **Pre-Execution Hook** | Before each tool execution | Allow, deny, or modify inputs and secrets |
| **Post-Execution Hook** | After tool execution | Allow, deny, or modify the output |

You only implement the hooks you need. Configure everything through the Arcade Dashboard.
