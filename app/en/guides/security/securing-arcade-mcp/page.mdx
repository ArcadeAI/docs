# Securing Arcade MCP Deployments

You may have noticed that when you connected to the MCP server you created with `arcade-mcp`, you could immediately call your tools from local MCP Clients and agents, like Claude and Cursor. This is because the `arcade-mcp` server is *not* secured by any mechanism by default.  Most use-cases for MCP servers today are local development or local to a single machine, and we optimize for that use-case.

However, you can secure your MCP server in two ways: deploying it to Arcade or adding front-door OAuth.

## Arcade Deploy
When you `arcade deploy` your MCP server, it will be secured behind the Arcade platform.

Under the hood, we disable the MCP routes provided by `arcade-mcp`, and use the Arcade Engine as a gateway for your MCP server, which has a number of additional features. Arcade will create a randomized secure secret for your MCP server (via the `ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET` environment variable) so that your server is protected from unauthorized access, as well as being isolated from direct access from outside of the Arcade platform. Servers managed by Arcade (servers that are `arcade deploy`ed) serve `/worker` endpoints that are protected by this secret. The worker endpoints are `worker/health`, `/worker/tools`, and `/worker/tools/invoke`. The health endpoint is not protected by this secret, but the listing tools and tool invocations are.  You can explore this behavior locally by setting the same environment variable in your local environment.

## OAuth Resource Server Auth

You can secure your MCP server's `/mcp` endpoints with OAuth 2.1 Resource Server auth. This turns your MCP server into a protected resource, enabling you to use tools with authorization and secrets over HTTP.

This approach is ideal when:
- You want to host your MCP server yourself (local, on-premise, or third-party hosting)
- You already have an OAuth 2.1 compliant Authorization Server (e.g., WorkOS AuthKit, Auth0, Descope)

Resource Server auth works alongside tool-level authorization. Resource Server auth secures access to the MCP server itself, while tool-level auth enables your tools to access third-party APIs on behalf of the authenticated user.

### Client ID Metadata Documents (Coming soon)

Coming soon, you will be able to secure your MCP server using Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) for authorization. Learn more about how MCP integrates with OAuth [here](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/client_registration/).
