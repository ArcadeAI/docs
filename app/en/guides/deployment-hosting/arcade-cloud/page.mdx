# Arcade Cloud infrastructure

Arcade Cloud is Arcade's fully managed SaaS platform—Arcade handles hosting, scaling, and operations so you can focus on building. This page covers the infrastructure behind Arcade Cloud, including networking, data storage, data protection, and sovereignty options.

<Callout type="info">
This page applies to **Arcade Cloud** only. If you self-host Arcade, you control your own infrastructure and data residency. See [on-premises deployment](/guides/deployment-hosting#on-premise-deployments) for details.
</Callout>

## Sovereignty

All of Arcade Cloud's infrastructure is located in the United States, including data storage and processing.

## Egress IP addresses

Traffic from Arcade Cloud exits from the following IP addresses:

```sh
# Control Plane (Located in the USA)
3.140.92.118
3.13.58.74
3.149.34.246

# MCP Server Cluster 1 (Located in the USA)
3.150.210.23
3.135.113.210
3.131.234.5
```

## VPC peering

VPC peering is available for enterprise customers upon request. If you want VPC peering, [contact Arcade](/resources/contact-us).

## Data storage

As part of Arcade's service, we store several categories of data:

### Application data (user-controlled)

Data stored in application databases where you have direct control over retention and deletion.

| Data type | Examples |
| --------- | -------- |
| **End-User Authentication** | OAuth tokens, API keys, identity information |
| **Secrets** | Project secrets, OAuth provider configurations |
| **Execution logs** | Tool execution logs for monitoring and debugging |
| **Audit trails** | Changes to significant data or configuration for your projects or organization |

You can disable log collection, set retention periods, and purge data on demand through your organization or project settings.

### Monitoring and analytics (platform-controlled)

Operational data that Arcade uses for system health, debugging, and analytics.

| Data type | Retention |
| --------- | --------- |
| **Application logs** | Up to 1 year |
| **Audit trails** | Up to 1 year |
| **Metrics and traces** | Up to 1 year |
| **Billing and transaction records** | Retained indefinitely for legal and financial compliance
| **Vulnerability and security reports** | Up to 6 months |

## Training data

### What Training Data Covers

Training data includes data which Arcade uses to improve its ML/AI models.  This includes data which could contain personally identifiable information (PII):

- **Tool queries** — Natural language inputs sent to tools
- **Tool execution inputs** — Parameters and arguments passed to tools
- **Tool execution results** — Outputs returned from tools, including data returned from external services

Training consent does **not** apply to:

- Aggregated, anonymized usage metrics
- System performance data
- Billing and transaction records

### Consent model

Arcade follows a customer-governed consent model that prioritizes transparency and control:

- **Opt-out is available anytime** through your organization or project settings — no review process, and it takes effect immediately.
- **Consent is scoped to the organization or project level.** Consent for data training is controlled buy the Arcade customer, and not end-users. For enterprise accounts, an organization admin manages consent for the team.



### When you opt out

When you revoke training consent:

- Data collection for training stops immediately
- Existing data is excluded from future training runs

### Retention

Training data is retained for up to 5 years, which is sufficient for model development and consistent with industry precedent.

## Data protection

### Encryption

| Layer | Standard |
| ----- | -------- |
| **At rest** | All production systems use encrypted storage volumes |
| **In transit** | TLS 1.2+ for all API communications |
| **Application-level** | Sensitive fields (tokens, secrets) use additional AES-256 encryption before persisting to storage |

### Deployment options

| Deployment mode | Data location control | Best for |
| --------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| **Arcade Cloud** | US only | Customers without data residency requirements |
| **Self-hosted** | Full customer control | Regulated industries and strict sovereignty requirements |

### Regulated Customers

If your organization has strict data residency requirements — for example, in financial services, healthcare, or government — or you operate within a legal regime that requires data to be stored in a specific country, you can deploy Arcade on-premises or in your preferred cloud region using a [self-hosted deployment](/guides/deployment-hosting#on-premise-deployments). This keeps all sensitive data within your own infrastructure.
