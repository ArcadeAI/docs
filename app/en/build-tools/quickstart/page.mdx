# Quick Start: Your First Custom Tool

Build a simple custom tool in under 5 minutes. This tutorial will help you understand the basics of creating MCP servers with Arcade.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An [Arcade API key](/get-started/setup/api-keys)

<Steps>

### Install the Arcade SDK

```bash
pip install arcade-ai
```

### Create your tool file

Create a new file called `my_tools.py`:

```python
from arcade.sdk import tool

@tool
def greet_user(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Greet a user by name.

    Args:
        name: The name of the person to greet

    Returns:
        A friendly greeting message
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Arcade."


@tool
def add_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Add two numbers together.

    Args:
        a: The first number
        b: The second number

    Returns:
        The sum of a and b
    """
    return a + b
```

### Test your tools locally

```bash
arcade dev my_tools.py
```

This starts a local MCP server. You can test it with:

```bash
arcade chat
```

Try asking: "Greet someone named Alice" or "Add 5 and 3"

### Connect to your IDE (optional)

Add your local server to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-tools": {
      "command": "arcade",
      "args": ["dev", "my_tools.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

</Steps>

- [Add secrets](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/create-tool-with-secrets) for API keys
- [Structure your MCP server](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/organize-tools) as it grows
- [Deploy to production](/build-tools/deploy)
