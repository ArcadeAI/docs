# Build Custom Tools

Need tools that don't exist in the catalog? Build your own MCP servers with custom logic and authentication.

<Callout type="info">
**Looking for pre-built tools?** Check the [Tool Catalog](/tool-catalog) first - we have 100+ integrations ready to use.
</Callout>

## When to Build Custom Tools

- You need to integrate with an internal API
- You want custom business logic in your tools
- The service you need isn't in the tool catalog yet
- You want to combine multiple operations into a single tool

## Getting Started

### 1. Quick Start (5 minutes)

Build your first tool to understand the basics.

[Start the quick tutorial →](/build-tools/quickstart)

### 2. MCP Server Basics

Learn how MCP servers work and how to structure your tools.

- [What is an MCP Server?](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/compare-mcp-server-types)
- [Build an MCP Server](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/build-mcp-server)
- [Organize your tools](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/organize-tools)

### 3. Add Authentication

Make your tools work with user credentials.

- [Create a tool with auth](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/create-tool-with-auth)
- [Create a tool with secrets](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/create-tool-with-secrets)
- [Server-level vs Tool-level auth](/learn/server-level-vs-tool-level-auth)

### 4. Test & Evaluate

Ensure your tools work correctly before deploying.

- [Why evaluate tools?](/guides/create-tools/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate)
- [Create an evaluation suite](/guides/create-tools/evaluate-tools/create-evaluation-suite)
- [Run evaluations](/guides/create-tools/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations)

### 5. Deploy

Get your tools running in production.

- [Deploy to Arcade Cloud](/guides/deployment-hosting/arcade-cloud) (easiest)
- [Self-host with Arcade Engine](/guides/deployment-hosting/configure-engine)
- [On-premise options](/guides/deployment-hosting/on-prem)

## Example: Simple Custom Tool

```python
from arcade.sdk import tool

@tool
def calculate_shipping(
    weight_kg: float,
    destination_country: str
) -> dict:
    """Calculate shipping cost based on weight and destination."""

    # Your custom business logic here
    base_rate = 5.00
    per_kg_rate = 2.50
    international_surcharge = 10.00 if destination_country != "US" else 0

    total = base_rate + (weight_kg * per_kg_rate) + international_surcharge

    return {
        "cost_usd": total,
        "estimated_days": 5 if destination_country == "US" else 14
    }
```
