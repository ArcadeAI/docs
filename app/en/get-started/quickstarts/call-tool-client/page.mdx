# Call a tool in your IDE/MCP Client

Tools enable your AI agents to perform actions on your behalf. For specific workflows and use cases, this may involve calling tools from multiple MCP servers. Arcade facilitates this by allowing you to create MCP Gateways to federate the tools from multiple MCP servers into a single collection for convenient management, control, and access. For example, if your agent specializes in solving specific tickets in Linear, you may want to use tools from the GitHub, Slack and Linear servers in your agent. These add up to 88 tools, which could be overwhelming for an LLM to use effectively. What you want is to get from these servers only the tools that matter for your agent. An MCP Gateway allows you to do just that: pick only the tools required for this workflow, and you can connect it to any MCP client, making it possible to port your agent to multiple platforms and IDEs, and even share it with other users.

<Steps>

### Create an MCP Gateway

**Create a new MCP Gateway.** Go to the [MCP Gateways dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/mcp-gateways), and click the "Create MCP Gateway" button.

<Image
  alt={"Create MCP Gateway"}
  className="max-w-full dark:hidden mt-4"
  src={"/images/mcp-gateway/create-mcp-gateway-light.png"}
  width={CREATE_MCP_GATEWAY_LIGHT_WIDTH / IMAGE_SCALE_FACTOR}
  height={CREATE_MCP_GATEWAY_LIGHT_HEIGHT / IMAGE_SCALE_FACTOR}
/>
<Image
  alt={"Create MCP Gateway"}
  className="hidden max-w-full dark:block mt-4"
  src={"/images/mcp-gateway/create-mcp-gateway-dark.png"}
  width={CREATE_MCP_GATEWAY_DARK_WIDTH / IMAGE_SCALE_FACTOR}
  height={CREATE_MCP_GATEWAY_DARK_HEIGHT / IMAGE_SCALE_FACTOR}
/>

Give your MCP gateway:

- A name
- A description
- A slug (optional: recommended for shareability, but auto-generates if left blank)

### Select the tools you want to include in the gateway

**Click the "Select Tools" button** in the form to select the tools you want to include in the gateway. You can select tools from any MCP server available to the active project. For this example, select the following tools:

- the GitHub MCP server
- the Linear MCP server

Feel free to select any tools you want to include in your specific use case.

  className="max-w-full dark:hidden mt-4"
  src={"/images/mcp-gateway/mcp-gateway-tool-filter-dev-light.png"}
  width={TOOL_PICKER_LIGHT_WIDTH / IMAGE_SCALE_FACTOR}
  height={TOOL_PICKER_LIGHT_HEIGHT / IMAGE_SCALE_FACTOR}
/>
<Image
  alt={"Tool Picker"}
  className="hidden max-w-full dark:block mt-4"
  src={"/images/mcp-gateway/mcp-gateway-tool-filter-dev-dark.png"}
  width={TOOL_PICKER_DARK_WIDTH / IMAGE_SCALE_FACTOR}
  height={TOOL_PICKER_DARK_HEIGHT / IMAGE_SCALE_FACTOR}
/>

Once you've selected the tools you want to include in the gateway, click the "Use N tools" button in the tool picker, and then click the "Create MCP Gateway" button to create the gateway.

<Callout type="info">
  You can select as many tools for your MCP Gateway, but be mindful of how the
  MCP clients will handle the large number of tools. Some clients may not handle
  a large number of tools well, and may consume a significant portion of the
  LLM's context window. As a rule of thumb, we recommend keeping the number of
  tools in a single MCP Gateway below 80.
</Callout>

### Connect the MCP Gateway to an MCP client

Arcade MCP Gateways are compatible with any MCP client that supports:

- Streamable HTTP transport
- MCP OAuth, or support for setting up headers for the HTTP transport

Get the URL of your MCP Gateway by clicking the "Copy URL" button in the MCP Gateway details page.

  height={MCP_GATEWAY_URL_LIGHT_HEIGHT / IMAGE_SCALE_FACTOR}

  height={MCP_GATEWAY_URL_DARK_HEIGHT / IMAGE_SCALE_FACTOR}
/>

<Tabs items={["Cursor", "VS Code"]} storageKey="preferredAgent">
  <Tabs.Tab>

    1. Open the command palette (Mac: Cmd + Shift + p / Windows: Ctrl + Shift + p) and select **Open MCP Settings**
    1. Click on the **New MCP Server** button

    Cursor will open the MCP settings file, and you can add a new entry to the `mcpServers` object:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "mcp-arcade": {
          "url": "https://api.arcade.dev/mcp/<YOUR-GATEWAY-SLUG>",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer {arcade_api_key}",
            "Arcade-User-ID": "{arcade_user_id}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    1. Open the command palette (Mac: Cmd + Shift + p / Windows: Ctrl + Shift + p) and select **MCP: Add Server...**
    1. Choose **HTTP**
    1. Paste the URL of your MCP Gateway.
    1. Give your MCP server a name, like `mcp-arcade`
    1. Visual Studio Code will update your `mcp.json` file.
    1. Either in the `mcp.json` file or in the "Extensions" > "MCP Servers - Installed" pane, click the "Start" button next to your MCP server and follow the prompts to authenticate.

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Try it out

1. Open your IDE's chat pane.
1. Ask the agent to do something! For example, "Check the latest linear issue assigned to me. Then, create a new GitHub branch, implement the fix, and add tests. If all the tests pass, create a pull request and assign it to me."

As you interact with the agent, it will call the tools from the MCP Gateway. Your agent should prompt you to visit links to authorize access to Linear and GitHub. After this, it will start using tools to carry out the task! Subsequent calls will not require authorization.
