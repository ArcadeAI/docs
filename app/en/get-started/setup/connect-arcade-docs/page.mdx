# Agentic Development

Give your AI IDE access to Arcade.dev's documentation using the [llms.txt](/llms.txt) file. This allows Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI IDEs to access the documentation and help you write code.

## LLMs.txt

LLMs.txt is a file format that allows you to give your AI IDE access to Arcade.dev's documentation in a format that the LLM can parse. All you need to do is paste in the content of the file into your IDE's settings, or reference the docs, for example via [Cursor's `@docs` annotation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols#docs).

The LLMs.txt files are available at [`/llms.txt`](/llms.txt).
