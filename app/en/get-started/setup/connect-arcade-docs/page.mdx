# Agentic Development

Give your AI IDE access to Arcade documentation using the [llms.txt](/llms.txt) file.

This page explains how to connect AI-powered IDEs like Claude Code and Cursor to Arcade documentation. This allows the IDE to reference the documentation when helping you write code, making development faster and reducing the need to manually search through docs.

## LLMs.txt

LLMs.txt is a file format that allows you to give your AI IDE access to Arcade documentation in a format that the LLM can parse. All you need to do is paste in the content of the file into your IDE's settings, or reference the docs, for example via [Cursor's `@docs` annotation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/symbols#docs).

The LLMs.txt files are available at [`/llms.txt`](/llms.txt).
