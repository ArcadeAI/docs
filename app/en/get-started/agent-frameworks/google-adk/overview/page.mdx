# Arcade with Google ADK

The `google-adk-arcade` package integrates [Arcade](https://arcade.dev) with the [Google ADK](https://github.com/google/adk-python/).

This integration enables AI developers working with Google's ADK framework to enhance their agents with Arcade tools including Google Mail, LinkedIn, GitHub, and many more. You'll use this when building AI agents that need to interact with external services through authenticated APIs. The integration handles tool management and user authorization, allowing you to focus on agent logic rather than infrastructure.

## Installation

Install the necessary packages to get started:

```bash
pip install google-adk-arcade
```

Make sure you have your Arcade API key ready. [Get an API key](/get-started/setup/api-keys) if you don't already have one.

## Key features

- Integration with the Google ADK framework
- Access to all Arcade MCP servers including Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, X, and more
- Create custom tools with the Arcade Tool SDK
- Manage user authorization for tools that require it
- Asynchronous support compatible with Google's ADK framework

## Basic usage

Here's an example of using Arcade tools with OpenAI Agents:

```python
import asyncio

from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
from google.adk import Agent, Runner
from google.adk.artifacts import InMemoryArtifactService
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.genai import types

from google_adk_arcade.tools import get_arcade_tools


async def main():
    app_name = 'my_app'
    user_id = '{arcade_user_id}'
    session_service = InMemorySessionService()
    artifact_service = InMemoryArtifactService()
    client = AsyncArcade()

    google_tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, tools=["Gmail.ListEmails"])

    # authorize the tools
    for tool in google_tools:
        result = await client.tools.authorize(
            tool_name=tool.name,
            user_id=user_id
        )
        if result.status != "completed":
            print(f"Click this link to authorize {tool.name}:\n{result.url}")
        await client.auth.wait_for_completion(result)

    # create the agent
    google_agent = Agent(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        name="google_tool_agent",
        instruction="I can use Google tools to manage an inbox!",
        description="An agent equipped with tools to read Gmail emails."
        tools=google_tools,
    )

    #create the session and pass the user ID to the state
    session = await session_service.create_session(
        app_name=app_name, user_id=user_id, state={
            "user_id": user_id,
        }
    )

    runner = Runner(
        app_name=app_name,
        agent=google_agent,
        artifact_service=artifact_service,
        session_service=session_service,
    )

    user_input = "summarize my latest 3 emails"
    content = types.Content(
        role='user', parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=user_input)]
    )
    for event in runner.run(
        user_id=user_id,
        session_id=session.id,
        new_message=content,
    ):
        if event.content.parts and event.content.parts[0].text:
            print(f'** {event.author}: {event.content.parts[0].text}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Handle authorization

When a user needs to authorize access to a tool (like Google or GitHub),
the agent will reply with a URL for the user to visit, which the user will see.

After visiting the URL and authorizing access, the user can run the agent again
with the same `user_id`, and it will work without requiring re-authorization.

Alternatively, you can authorize the tool before running the agent:

```python
# authorize the tools
for tool in google_tools:
    result = await client.tools.authorize(
        tool_name=tool.name,
        user_id=user_id
    )
    if result.status != "completed":
        print(f"Click this link to authorize {tool.name}:\n{result.url}")
    await client.auth.wait_for_completion(result)
```
