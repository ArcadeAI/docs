# Twitch auth provider

<Callout type="info">
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Twitch Auth Provider. To use
  Twitch auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Twitch OAuth
  2.0 credentials as described below.
</Callout>

The Twitch auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Twitch API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Twitch auth provider seamlessly manage Twitch OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Twitch auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-twitch-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Twitch APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-twitch-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Twitch APIs

## Configuring Twitch auth

### Create a Twitch app

- Twitch requires that you have two-factor authentication enabled for your account. Enable in your [account security seetings](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security)
- Create a Twitch Application in the [Twitch App Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
- Set the OAuth Redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
- Select your Application category
- Select the 'Confidential' Client Type
- Copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you'll need below

Next, add the Twitch app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring Twitch auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Twitch** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-twitch-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Twitch app.
5. Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Twitch app's OAuth Redirect URL.
6. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Twitch auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Twitch OAuth provider.

### Configuring Twitch auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

<Callout type="info">
  The Client ID is the Twitch "App key" and the Client Secret is the Twitch "App
  secret".
</Callout>

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Callout>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more
  information on how to set environment variables and configure the Arcade
  Engine.
</Callout>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `twitch` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml {3-9}
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-twitch
      description: "The default Twitch provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: twitch
      client_id: ${env:TWITCH_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

</Steps>

## Using Twitch auth in app code

Use the Twitch auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Twitch API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Twitch API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python {8-12}
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="twitch",
    scopes=["channel:manage:polls"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript {8-10}
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "twitch", {
  scopes: ["channel:manage:polls"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Twitch auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Twitch API.

Use the `Twitch()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Twitch. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Twitch token:

```python {5-6,9-13,36}
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Twitch


@tool(
    requires_auth=Twitch(
        scopes=["channel:manage:polls"],
    )
)
async def create_poll(
    context: ToolContext,
    broadcaster_id: Annotated[
        str,
        "The ID of the broadcaster to create the poll for.",
    ],
    title: Annotated[
        str,
        "The title of the poll.",
    ],
    choices: Annotated[
        list[str],
        "The choices of the poll.",
    ],
    duration: Annotated[
        int,
        "The duration of the poll in seconds.",
    ],
) -> Annotated[dict, "The poll that was created"]:
    """Create a poll for a Twitch channel."""
    url = "https://api.twitch.tv/helix/polls"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
        "Client-Id": "your_client_id",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    payload = {
        "broadcaster_id": broadcaster_id,
        "title": title,
        "choices": [{"title": choice} for choice in choices],
        "duration": duration,
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
