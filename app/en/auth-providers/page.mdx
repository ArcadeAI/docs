# Auth Providers

<Callout type="warning">
**This section is for configuring OAuth connections, NOT for using pre-built tools.**

- **Looking for ready-to-use tools?** → Go to [Tool Catalog](/tool-catalog)
- **Want to use Gmail, Slack, GitHub tools?** → Go to [Tool Catalog](/tool-catalog)
- **Need to configure custom OAuth?** → You're in the right place!
</Callout>

## What are Auth Providers?

Auth Providers are OAuth configurations that enable Arcade to authenticate with external services. They define:

- OAuth client credentials (client ID, secret)
- Authorization and token URLs
- Required scopes and permissions

## When Do You Need This Section?

You need to configure an auth provider when:

1. **You're building custom tools** that require OAuth authentication
2. **You're self-hosting Arcade** and need to set up your own OAuth apps
3. **You need custom scopes** beyond what's available in pre-built tools
4. **The service you need** doesn't have a pre-built integration

<Callout type="info">
**Most users don't need this section.** If you're using Arcade Cloud with pre-built integrations, OAuth is already configured for you.
</Callout>

## Supported Providers

Arcade supports OAuth for 30+ services. See the full list in the [Auth Provider Reference](/references/auth-providers).

### Popular Providers

| Provider | Documentation |
|----------|---------------|
| Google | [Configure Google OAuth](/references/auth-providers/google) |
| Microsoft | [Configure Microsoft OAuth](/references/auth-providers/microsoft) |
| GitHub | [Configure GitHub OAuth](/references/auth-providers/github) |
| Slack | [Configure Slack OAuth](/references/auth-providers/slack) |
| Salesforce | [Configure Salesforce OAuth](/references/auth-providers/salesforce) |

[See all 30+ providers →](/references/auth-providers)

## Adding a Custom OAuth Provider

If the service you need isn't in our list, you can add a custom OAuth 2.0 provider.

## Common Confusion: Auth Providers vs Integrations

| Auth Providers | Integrations (Tool Catalog) |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| OAuth configuration | Ready-to-use tools |
| For custom tools | For using existing tools |
| Technical setup | Just connect and use |
| "How to authenticate" | "What actions can I take" |

**Example:**
- "I want to send emails via Gmail" → [Gmail Integration](/tool-catalog/productivity/gmail) (Tool Catalog)
- "I want to configure Google OAuth for my custom tool" → [Google Auth Provider](/references/auth-providers/google) (This section)
