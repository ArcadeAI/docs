# Use Arcade Tools in Your Agent or App

Build applications that can take real action using Arcade's 100+ pre-built integrations. Integrate with your favorite agent framework and let your AI send emails, manage tasks, and interact with APIs on behalf of users.

## Choose Your Framework

Select your agent framework to get started:

## Key Concepts

### User Authentication

When building user-facing applications, you'll need to handle authentication so your agent can act on behalf of users.

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Understanding authentication patterns is critical for production apps. Users need to authorize your app to access their Gmail, Slack, etc.
</Callout>

## Quick Example (Python)

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

# Initialize the client
client = Arcade()

# Call a tool
response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="Google.SendEmail",
    inputs={
        "to": "user@example.com",
        "subject": "Hello from Arcade",
        "body": "This email was sent by an AI agent!"
    },
    user_id="user_123"  # The user whose credentials to use
)
```
