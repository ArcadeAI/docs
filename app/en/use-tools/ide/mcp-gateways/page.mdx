**What is an MCP Gateway?**
An MCP Gateway is a hosted endpoint that gives your MCP client access to Arcade's tool catalog. No local server installation required.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
### Create a Gateway

1. Go to the [Arcade Dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard)
2. Click **Create Gateway**
3. Select the tools you want to enable
4. Copy the connection URL

### Connect Your Client

Add the gateway URL to your MCP client's configuration. See client-specific guides:

Your AI assistant now has access to the tools you enabled. Try asking it to:
- "Check my Gmail for unread messages"
- "Create a new issue in Jira"
- "Send a message in Slack"
