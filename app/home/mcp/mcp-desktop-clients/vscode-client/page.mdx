# Use Arcade in Visual Studio Code

In this guide, you'll learn how to connect Visual Studio Code to Arcade.dev's MCP server.

<Note>
  As of version 1.100.0, Visual Studio Code does not yet support [MCP
  authorization](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization).
  Only tools that do not require auth, such as math and
  [search](/toolkits/search/google_search) tools, will work with Visual Studio
  Code. We're working to improve this - stay tuned!
</Note>

<Steps>

### Set up Visual Studio Code

1. Download and open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (version 1.100.0 or higher)
1. Open the command palette and select **MCP: Add Server...**
1. Choose **HTTP**
1. Paste the following URL: `https://api.arcade.dev/v1/mcps/arcade-anon/mcp`

   <Info>
     This URL is Arcade's public beta MCP server. We'd love to [hear your
     feedback](/home/contact-us)! Coming soon: deploy a server with your own
     tools.
   </Info>

1. Give your MCP server a name, like `mcp-arcade-dev`

Visual Studio Code will update your `settings.json` file with the following:

```json
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "mcp-arcade-dev": {
                "url": "https://api.arcade.dev/v1/mcps/arcade-anon/mcp"
            }
        }
    },
```

### Try it out

1. Open the chat pane (typically Cmd-Shift-I or Ctrl-Shift-I)
1. Make sure you are in **Agent** mode
1. Click the üõ†Ô∏è Tools button, which opens a panel of available tools
1. Click to select the tools you want to use, and type your request in the chat pane!
