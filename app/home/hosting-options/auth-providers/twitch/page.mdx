# Twitch auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Twitch Auth Provider. To use
  Twitch auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Twitch OAuth
  2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Twitch auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Twitch API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Twitch auth provider seamlessly manage Twitch OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Twitch auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-twitch-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Twitch APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-twitch-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Twitch APIs

## Configuring Twitch auth

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Twitch app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Twitch credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/hosting-options/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Twitch app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Twitch app.

### Create a Twitch app

- Twitch requires that you have two-factor authentication enabled for your account. Enable in your [account security seetings](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security)
- Create a Twitch Application in the [Twitch App Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
- Set the OAuth Redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Select your Application category
- Select the 'Confidential' Client Type
- Copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you'll need below

Next, add the Twitch app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Twitch Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Twitch app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

### Configure Twitch Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Twitch**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-twitch-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Twitch app.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Twitch auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Twitch OAuth provider. If you have multiple Twitch providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/hosting-options/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Twitch auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

<Note>
  The Client ID is the Twitch "App key" and the Client Secret is the Twitch "App
  secret".
</Note>

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/hosting-options/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `twitch` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/twitch/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Twitch auth in app code

Use the Twitch auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Twitch API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/core-concepts/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Twitch API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/twitch/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/twitch/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Twitch auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/authoring-tools/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Twitch API.

Use the `Twitch()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Twitch. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Twitch token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/twitch/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,36}

```
