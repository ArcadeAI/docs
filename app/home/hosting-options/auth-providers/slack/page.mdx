# Slack auth provider

The Slack auth provider enables tools and agents to call [Slack APIs](https://api.slack.com/docs) on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Slack auth provider seamlessly manage Slack OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with Slack in your agent or AI app? The pre-built
  [Arcade Slack toolkit](/toolkits/categories/social-communication/slack) is what you want!
</Tip>

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Slack auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Slack toolkit](/toolkits/categories/social-communication/slack), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Slack
- Your [app code](#using-slack-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the Slack API
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-slack-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the Slack API

## Configuring Slack auth

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Slack app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Slack credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/hosting-options/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Slack app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Slack app.

### Create a Slack app

<Warning>
  In May 29, 2025, [Slack announced](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2025-05-terms-rate-limit-update-and-faq) changes to their API rate-limits and terms of service for apps that are not approved for the Slack Marketplace.

  The `conversations.history` and `conversations.replies` endpoints are now limited to 1 request/minute and up to 15 objects returned per request. This affects various tools in the [Arcade Slack toolkit](/toolkits/categories/social-communication/slack). Additionally, the [API Terms of Service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api) now requires [Slack Marketplace](https://api.slack.com/slack-marketplace/using) approval for commercial distribution.
</Warning>

- Follow Slack's guide to [registering a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/quickstart)
- If you plan to use the [Arcade Slack toolkit](/toolkits/categories/social-communication/slack), select the scopes below (include additional scopes for your application's authorization needs or custom tools, in any):
  - `channels:history`
  - `channels:read`
  - `chat:write`
  - `groups:read`
  - `groups:history`
  - `groups:write`
  - `im:history`
  - `im:read`
  - `im:write`
  - `mpim:history`
  - `mpim:read`
  - `mpim:write`
  - `users:read`
  - `users:read.email`
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

Next, add the Slack app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Slack Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Slack app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure Slack Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Slack**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-slack-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Slack app.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Slack auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Slack OAuth provider. If you have multiple Slack providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/hosting-options/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Slack auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SLACK_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
SLACK_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/hosting-options/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `slack` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Slack auth in app code

Use the Slack auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Slack API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/core-concepts/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Slack API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/custom_auth.py {8-17}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Slack auth in custom tools

You can use the pre-built [Arcade Slack toolkit](/toolkits/categories/social-communication/slack) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Slack.

If the pre-built tools in the Slack toolkit don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/authoring-tools/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Slack API.

Use the `Slack()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Slack. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Slack token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/custom_tool.py {5-6,10-19,30}

```
