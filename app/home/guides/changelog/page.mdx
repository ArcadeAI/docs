<Note>
  Most Arcade toolkits have been removed from the
  `github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai` repository, and transitioned to closed-source.
  Toolkit source code remains available upon request for our paying customers.
  This enables us to iterate more quickly and provide a better experience for
  our customers. The previously open-sourced toolkits are still available in the
  public repository's git history.
</Note>

## For the week ending on 2025-07-18

<Note>
  Version 2.0.0 of the Arcade Engine was released this week.  Upgrading to version 2.0.0 is recommended for all self-hosted developers, and includes an important security fix for [secure OAuth flows](/home/core-concepts/auth/secure-auth-production).  After upgrading, all projects will default to using the Arcade user verifier.  If desired, you can then implement a custom user verifier in your application/agent and make the switch via the Arcade Dashboard.

Self-hosed Arcade developers cannot be grandfathered into the old (insecure) behavior of skipping user verification once the Engine is upgraded to version 2.0.0 or higher.
