### Install and use Arcade

<Steps>

### Install Arcade Python Client

Fire up your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install arcadepy
```

### Set your Arcade API key

<SetApiKey />

### Set up the Arcade client

Create an `example.py` script and instantiate the Arcade client:

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()
```

Alternatively, you can initialize the client passing your API key as an argument, but it is not recommended to hardcode sensitive information:

```python
client = Arcade(api_key="your_api_key_here")
```

### Call a tool

You are now ready to call tools. Follow the [Call Tools Directly](/home/use-tools/call-tools-directly) guide next.
