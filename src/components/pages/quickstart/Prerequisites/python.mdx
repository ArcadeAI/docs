### Install and use Arcade

<Steps>

### Install Arcade Python Client

Fire up your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install arcadepy
```

### Set your Arcade API key

<SetApiKey />

### Set up the Arcade client

In your Python application, import the Arcade client and initialize it:

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()
```

Alternatively, you can initialize the client passing your API key as an argument, but it is not recommended to hardcode sensitive information:

```python
client = Arcade(api_key="your_api_key_here")
```

### Call a tool

You can now call tools using the Arcade client. Here's an example of calling the `Math.Sqrt` tool:

```python
response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="Math.Sqrt",
    input={"a": "625"},
    user_id="user@example.com",
)
print(response.output.value)
```
