- **Node.js 18** or higher <br/> Verify your Node.js version by running `node --version` in your terminal. Don't have it? Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **npm**: Your package manager included with Node.js
- **pip**: Ensure you have pip, the Python package installer. It is included with Python, but you can verify it by running `pip --version`.

### Install and use Arcade

<Steps>

### Obtain an API key

Install the Arcade CLI and SDK and log in. Your Arcade API key will be printed to the console as well as saved to `~/.arcade/credentials.yaml`.

```bash
pip install 'arcade-ai[fastapi]'
arcade login
```

<Tip>Obtaining an API key through the Arcade dashboard is coming soon!</Tip>

### Install the SDK

Fire up your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install openai
```

### Set up your OpenAI client

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

export const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://api.arcade.dev/v1",
  apiKey: process.env["ARCADE_API_KEY"],
});
```

<details className="rounded-lg border border-blue-100 bg-blue-50/30 p-4 my-4 dark:border-blue-900/50 dark:bg-blue-950/30 hover:bg-blue-100/50 dark:hover:bg-blue-950/40 transition-colors">
  <summary className="flex items-center gap-2 text-sm font-medium dark:hover:bg-transparent">
    <Info className="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 w-4 h-4" />
    <span>Keep your API key secure with environment variables</span>
  </summary>

  <div className="mt-4 text-sm text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
    We recommend storing your API key in a `.env` file:

    1. Create a `.env` file:

    ```
    ARCADE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

  </div>
</details>

### Call a tool

You can now call tools with your client. Here's an example of calling a tool using OpenAI's chat completion:

```typescript
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What's the square root of 625?" }],
  tools: ["Math.Sqrt"],
  tool_choice: "generate",
  user: "your.email@example.com",
});

console.log(response.data.choices[0].message.content);
```
