### Use our REST API

You can interact with Arcade AI's REST API. Here's an example of a `GET` request to the chat completions endpoint:

```bash
curl https://api.arcade-ai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the squared root of 625"}],
    "tools": ["Math.Sqrt"],
    "tool_choice": "generate",
    "user": "your.email@example.com"
  }'
```
