## MCP Overview
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") MCP Overview

# Model Context Protocol (MCP): The Arcade.dev Perspective

## What is MCP and Why Should Developers Care? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#what-is-mcp-and-why-should-developers-care)

Model Context Protocol represents a significant step toward standardizing how AI agents interact with tools and external systems. As the developer-first platform for authenticated tool-calling, Arcade.dev has been at the forefront of connecting AI models to real-world actions - which is why our perspective on MCP matters.

For developers building AI applications that need to do more than just generate text, understanding the strengths and limitations of protocols like MCP is critical to making informed architecture decisions.

## The Current State of Model Context Protocol [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#the-current-state-of-model-context-protocol)

MCP aims to standardize how AI models access and use applications to get data or use tools - a problem space Arcade.dev has been solving since day one. While the protocol rightly focuses on how applications provide context to LLMs, our hands-on experience building production agent systems reveals both opportunities and challenges.

### Where MCP Gets It Right [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#where-mcp-gets-it-right)

- **Standardization attempt**: Creating common patterns for tool definitions across different AI providers is a step in the right direction. It allows agent builders to switch between different LLM providers and optimize costs and performance for each component using an LLM.
- **Focus on function-calling**: Correctly identifies that giving AI models the ability to call functions is fundamental to realize the agent’s full potential. The protocol got the difference between LLM resources and regular APIs right from the beginning. While traditional APIs are designed for developers to use, LLM-optimized tools require additional context to be used effectively by AI systems. The recognition of what we call [Machine Experience Engineering](https://blog.arcade.dev/the-birth-of-machine-experience-engineering) is something MCP designers also identified early on.
- **Community momentum**: Building adoption across multiple providers creates healthy ecosystem dynamics, giving all actors that adopt MCP the benefits of a robust, well-tested and growing ecosystem of LLM-ready resources, both local and remote.

### Where MCP is Evolving [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#where-mcp-is-evolving)

- **Authentication gaps**: The protocol was initially designed for local resources only, and required considerable technical knowledge to integrate with clients like VSCode, Cursor, and Claude Desktop. 99% of MCP servers today are built for single-user use, even hosted ones. If you need to configure the MCP server with a PAT (personal access token) or an API key, it’s not usable by a multi-user (B2B2C) or cloud-based agent. At a minimum, MCP servers need to support [HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http), [MCP authorization](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization), and support multi-user authorization. Having a robust standard for tool calling without the same robustness for auth quickly began the adoption of ad-hoc solutions that were more or less insecure for remote tool calling, the #1 bottleneck in moving AI agents to production. Fortunately, active work is ongoing on the MCP community to adopt a solid auth component in the protocol. [Arcade.dev’s own auth team actively contribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1sLBGWnByc) to the specification in this crucial area.
- **Production readiness**: Enterprise-grade concerns like observability, security, and compliance need stronger representation. As the protocol evolves, we expect all of these aspects to be integrated into the protocol.
- **Developer experience**: Implementation complexity can create significant friction for teams without specialized AI expertise. MCP is a very new protocol undergoing rapid changes, so the DX is expected to be turbulent until the protocol matures. Arcade.dev supports this from day one while providing the best DX for building tools that can be served over MCP to any AI agent.

## How Arcade.dev Complements and Extends MCP [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#how-arcadedev-complements-and-extends-mcp)

Rather than viewing MCP as either perfect or problematic, we see it as part of an evolving ecosystem. Arcade.dev bridges critical gaps in the protocol by providing:

1. **Authentication-first architecture**: Secure, OAuth-based connections that let AI access tools as the end user - not as a “bot”
2. **Production infrastructure**: Monitoring, logging, and evaluation capabilities built for enterprise deployment. This also includes improvements to tool selection when many tools are enabled.
3. **Developer acceleration**: SDKs that dramatically reduce time-to-value when implementing tool-calling patterns
4. **Multi-model compatibility**: Works seamlessly with all major LLM providers, regardless of their MCP implementation status. You can start building your agents today, and switch to MCP seamlessly when your LLM provider supports it, or when the MCP SDK reaches enterprise level readiness

## Why This Matters for Your AI Applications [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#why-this-matters-for-your-ai-applications)

AI that can’t authenticate to access accounts or use data is fundamentally limited. This disconnect is why less than 30% of AI projects go to production.

The biggest opportunity in AI today isn’t better models—it’s enabling those models to take real actions. Developers need secure connections between AI and authenticated services, user data, and enterprise systems.

By combining MCP’s standardization efforts with Arcade.dev’s authentication-first approach, developers can build AI applications that don’t just suggest actions—they take them.

## Our Commitment to the Protocol Ecosystem [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#our-commitment-to-the-protocol-ecosystem)

At Arcade.dev, we’re active participants in the evolving tool-calling ecosystem. Our team contributes to open standards like MCP while building the production-grade infrastructure developers need today.

As Sam Partee, our CTO, explains: “Protocols like MCP are important stepping stones toward more capable AI agents. Our focus is making sure developers can build with these patterns today, with authentication and security baked in from the start.”

## Frequently Asked MCP Questions [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#frequently-asked-mcp-questions)

### Is Arcade.dev an alternative to MCP? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#is-arcadedev-an-alternative-to-mcp)

No. Arcade.dev complements protocol standards like MCP by providing the authentication layer, developer tooling, and production infrastructure needed to implement them successfully in real-world applications. Arcade’s Engine can be an MCP server with super-powers, and you can pull in upstream MCP servers as tools into Arcade.

### Do I need to understand MCP to use Arcade.dev? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#do-i-need-to-understand-mcp-to-use-arcadedev)

Not at all. Arcade.dev provides intuitive SDKs that handle the complexities of tool-calling patterns, regardless of which underlying protocol standards are in use.

### What models work with Arcade.dev’s approach to MCP? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#what-models-work-with-arcadedevs-approach-to-mcp)

Arcade.dev works with all major models including Claude, GPT-4, Llama, Mistral, and more - supporting both MCP-compatible and non-MCP implementations through our unified API.

### How does Arcade.dev handle authentication within the MCP framework? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview\#how-does-arcadedev-handle-authentication-within-the-mcp-framework)

Arcade.dev extends(\*) basic MCP implementations with enterprise-grade OAuth flows, secure token management, and fine-grained permissions - solving the authentication gap that often blocks production deployment.

(\*) Arcade is currently compatible with the existing ratified MCP specifications, and is working to extend them for [tool authorization](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/475).

## Twitch Auth Configuration
[Integrations](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits "Integrations") [Entertainment](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/spotify "Entertainment") Twitch

# Twitch auth provider

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Twitch Auth Provider. To use
Twitch auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Twitch
OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Twitch auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Twitch API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Twitch auth provider seamlessly manage Twitch OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Twitch auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch#using-twitch-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Twitch APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch#using-twitch-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Twitch APIs

## Configuring Twitch auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch\#configuring-twitch-auth)

### Create a Twitch app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch\#create-a-twitch-app)

- Twitch requires that you have two-factor authentication enabled for your account. Enable in your [account security seetings](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security)
- Create a Twitch Application in the [Twitch App Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
- Set the OAuth Redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Select your Application category
- Select the ‘Confidential’ Client Type
- Copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you’ll need below

Next, add the Twitch app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring Twitch auth with the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch\#configuring-twitch-auth-with-the-arcade-dashboard)

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Twitch** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-twitch-provider”) with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Twitch app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Twitch auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Twitch OAuth provider.

### Configuring Twitch auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch\#configuring-twitch-auth-in-self-hosted-arcade-engine-configuration)

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch\#set-environment-variables)

The Client ID is the Twitch “App key” and the Client Secret is the Twitch
“App secret”.

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `twitch` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-twitch
      description: "The default Twitch provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: twitch
      client_id: ${env:TWITCH_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using Twitch auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch\#using-twitch-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Twitch auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Twitch API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Twitch API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="twitch",
    scopes=["channel:manage:polls"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "twitch", {
  scopes: ["channel:manage:polls"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Twitch auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/entertainment/twitch\#using-twitch-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Twitch API.

Use the `Twitch()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Twitch. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Twitch token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Twitch


@tool(
    requires_auth=Twitch(
        scopes=["channel:manage:polls"],
    )
)
async def create_poll(
    context: ToolContext,
    broadcaster_id: Annotated[\
        str,\
        "The ID of the broadcaster to create the poll for.",\
    ],
    title: Annotated[\
        str,\
        "The title of the poll.",\
    ],
    choices: Annotated[\
        list[str],\
        "The choices of the poll.",\
    ],
    duration: Annotated[\
        int,\
        "The duration of the poll in seconds.",\
    ],
) -> Annotated[dict, "The poll that was created"]:
    """Create a poll for a Twitch channel."""
    url = "https://api.twitch.tv/helix/polls"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
        "Client-Id": "your_client_id",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    payload = {
        "broadcaster_id": broadcaster_id,
        "title": title,
        "choices": [{"title": choice} for choice in choices],
        "duration": duration,
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

# Installing Arcade Locally

This guide will help you install Arcade and set up your development environment. If you are developing tools to use with Arcade, this guide will provide you with a complete local deployment of Arcade for developing and testing tools.

## Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#prerequisites)

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **pip**: The Python package installer should be available. It’s typically included with Python.
- **Arcade Account**: Sign up for an [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=local-install) if you haven’t already.
- **Package Manager**: Either Brew (macOS) or Apt (linux) to install the engine binary.

Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.

## Installation [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#installation)

### Install the Client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#install-the-client)

To connect to the cloud or local Arcade Engine, we need to install the Arcade CLI from the `arcade-ai` package.

```nextra-code
pip install arcade-ai
arcade login
```

For a simple example on using the Arcade CLI, see the [quickstart on building tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit)

### Install the Engine [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#install-the-engine)

To run the Arcade Engine locally, you’ll need to install `arcade-engine`. Choose the installation method that matches your operating system.

This will install a template engine configuration.

macOS (Homebrew)Ubuntu/Debian (APT)Windows (coming soon)

```nextra-code
brew install ArcadeAI/tap/arcade-engine
```

```nextra-code
wget -qO - https://deb.arcade.dev/public-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://deb.arcade.dev/ubuntu stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/arcade-ai.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install arcade-engine
```

```nextra-code
Windows support is coming soon!
```

Want to see Windows support sooner? Show your interest by adding a 👍 to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/issues/258).

### Install a toolkit [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#install-a-toolkit)

In order to run the Arcade worker, you’ll need to install at least one tool. For local development, you can just `pip install` a tool in the same environment as the client.

```nextra-code
pip install arcade-math
```

For more information on installing toolkits, see the [Toolkit Installation](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/toolkits) page.

To see all available toolkits, view the [Toolkits Page](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits).

### Set OpenAI API key [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#set-openai-api-key)

Before starting the Engine, we need to set an OpenAI API Key that the Engine can use to connect to OpenAI.

Edit the `engine.env` file to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

```nextra-code
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your_openai_api_key>"
```

See the [configuration overview](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/overview) for more information on how to configure Arcade Engine and how to locate the `engine.env` file.

### Start the Engine and worker [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#start-the-engine-and-worker)

To run both the engine and a local worker, follow these steps:

1. First, start the worker:

```nextra-code
arcade serve
```

2. Then, start the engine:

```nextra-code
arcade-engine
```

The Engine and worker should both be running locally now.

To run the Engine on it’s own, you can run:

```nextra-code
arcade-engine
```

Note that the Engine requires at least one Arcade worker to run.

### Connect [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#connect)

To chat with the running Engine, in a separate terminal instance, run:

```nextra-code
arcade chat -h localhost
```

You are now chatting with Arcade locally!

## Next Steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#next-steps)

- **Building Tools**: Learn how to build tools with your local Arcade Instance in the [Creating a Toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) guide.
- **Hosting With Docker**: Learn how to run the [Engine in Docker](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/docker).

## Troubleshooting [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#troubleshooting)

### Engine Binary Not Found [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#engine-binary-not-found)

```nextra-code
❌ Engine binary not found
```

or

```nextra-code
command not found: arcade-engine
```

This means that the Arcade Engine cannot be found in your path. Brew and Apt will automatically add the binary to you path.

Check that the binary has been properly installed (These are the common installation locations):

**Brew**

```nextra-code
ls $HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY/Cellar/arcade-engine/<version>/bin/arcade-engine
```

**Apt**

```nextra-code
ls /usr/bin/arcade-engine
```

If the binary is found, add it to your path with:

```nextra-code
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/binary
```

### Toolkits Not Found [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#toolkits-not-found)

```nextra-code
No toolkits found in Python environment. Exiting...
```

This means that there are no toolkits found in the same environment as the Arcade SDK. Ensure that you are installing the toolkit package in the same environment and see the [Toolkit Installation Guide](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/toolkits) for more details.

### Engine Config Not Found [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local\#engine-config-not-found)

```nextra-code
❌ Config file 'engine.yaml' not found in any of the default locations.
```

or

```nextra-code
Arcade Engine has finished with error: unable to read config file $HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml: open $HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml: no such file or directory
```

The engine config may be located in one of the following directories:

- $HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml
- $HOMEBREW\_REPOSITORY/etc/arcade-engine/engine.yaml (Homebrew)
- /etc/arcade-ai/engine.yaml (Apt)

The engine config will be downloaded by and added to one of these locations when installing the engine.

When running the engine, the config needs to be in the `$HOME/.arcade/` directory or explicitly located with `arcade-engine -c /path/to/engine.yaml`.

If you cannot find your engine config, you can save and use the [Configuration Templates](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/templates).

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/notion\#auth)

The Arcade Notion toolkit uses the [Notion auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/notion) to connect to users’ Notion accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there’s nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Notion auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/notion#configuring-notion-auth) with your own Notion app credentials.

## X Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") X

# X auth provider

The X auth provider enables tools and agents to call the X (Twitter) API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the X auth provider seamlessly manage X OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

Want to quickly get started with X services in your agent or AI app? The
pre-built [Arcade X toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/x) is what you
want!

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure X auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade X toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/x), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with X
- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x#using-x-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call X APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x#using-x-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call X APIs

## Configuring X auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#configuring-x-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own X app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own X credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your X app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a X app.

### Create an X app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#create-an-x-app)

- Follow X’s guide to [creating an app](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-x-api)
- Enable user authentication for your new app, and set its type to “Web App, Automated App or Bot”
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the X app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own X Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#configuring-your-own-x-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your X app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure X Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **X**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-x-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your X app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require X auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this X OAuth provider. If you have multiple X providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring X auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export X_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export X_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
X_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
X_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add an `x` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-x
      description: "The default X provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: x
      client_id: ${env:X_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:X_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using X auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#using-x-auth-in-app-code)

Use the X auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the X API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for X:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="x",
    scopes=["tweet.read", "tweet.write", "users.read"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "x", [\
  "tweet.read",\
  "tweet.write",\
  "users.read",\
]);

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using X auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/x\#using-x-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can use the pre-built [Arcade X toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/x) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with X.

If the pre-built tools in the X toolkit don’t meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the X API.

Use the `X()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with X. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s X token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import X


@tool(
    requires_auth=X(
        scopes=["tweet.read", "tweet.write", "users.read"],
    )
)
async def post_tweet(
    context: ToolContext,
    tweet_text: Annotated[str, "The text content of the tweet you want to post"],
) -> Annotated[str, "Success string and the URL of the tweet"]:
    """Post a tweet to X (Twitter)."""
    url = "https://api.x.com/2/tweets"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    payload = {"text": tweet_text}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()

        tweet_id = response.json()["data"]["id"]
        return f"Tweet with id {tweet_id} posted successfully. URL: https://x.com/x/status/{tweet_id}"
```

## User Authentication Flows
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Mastra](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/overview "Mastra") Managing user authorization

## Dynamic Tool Loading with Toolsets [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/user-auth-interrupts\#dynamic-tool-loading-with-toolsets)

Mastra lets you dynamically provide tools to an agent at runtime using toolsets. This approach is essential when integrating Arcade tools in web applications where each user needs their own authentication flow.

### Per-User Tool Authentication in Web Applications [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/user-auth-interrupts\#per-user-tool-authentication-in-web-applications)

In web applications serving multiple users, implement user-specific authentication flows with these steps:

First, set up your Mastra configuration and agents in separate files:

```nextra-code
// @/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { githubAgent } from "./agents/githubAgent";

// Initialize Mastra
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: {
    githubAgent,
  },
});
```

```nextra-code
// @/mastra/agents/githubAgent.ts
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";

// Create the agent without tools - we'll add them at runtime
export const githubAgent = new Agent({
  name: "githubAgent",
  instructions: `You are a GitHub Agent that helps with repository management.

  You can help with tasks like:
  - Listing repositories
  - Creating and managing issues
  - Viewing pull requests
  - Managing repository settings

  If a tool requires authorization, you will receive an authorization URL.
  When that happens, clearly present this URL to the user and ask them to visit it to grant permissions.`,
  model: anthropic("claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"),
  // No tools defined here - will be provided dynamically at runtime
});
```

Then, create an API endpoint that provides tools dynamically:

```nextra-code
// app/api/chat/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { mastra } from "@/mastra";
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";
import { getUserSession } from "@/lib/auth"; // Your authentication handling
import { toZodToolSet } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";
import { executeOrAuthorizeZodTool } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  // Extract request data
  const { messages, threadId } = await req.json();

  // Authenticate the user
  const session = await getUserSession(req);
  if (!session) {
    return NextResponse.json({ message: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
  }

  try {
    // Get the agent from Mastra
    const githubAgent = mastra.getAgent("githubAgent");

    const arcade = new Arcade();
    const githubToolkit = await arcade.tools.list({ toolkit: "github", limit: 30 });

    // Fetch user-specific Arcade tools for GitHub
    const arcadeTools = toZodToolSet({
      tools: githubToolkit.items,
      client: arcade,
      userId: session.user.email,
      executeFactory: executeOrAuthorizeZodTool,
    });

    // Stream the response with dynamically provided tools
    const response = await githubAgent.stream(messages, {
      threadId, // Optional: For maintaining conversation context
      resourceId: session.user.id, // Optional: For associating memory with user
      toolChoice: "auto",
      toolsets: {
        arcade: arcadeTools, // Provide tools in a named toolset
      },
    });

    // Return streaming response
    return response.toDataStreamResponse();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error processing GitHub request:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { message: "Failed to process request" },
      { status: 500 },
    );
  }
}
```

This approach provides several benefits:

- Each user gets their own separate authentication flow with Arcade tools
- A single agent instance works with multiple user-specific toolsets

The toolsets parameter provides tools only for the current request without modifying the agent’s base configuration. This makes it ideal for multi-user applications where each user needs their own secure OAuth flow with Arcade.

## Handling Tool Authorization [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/user-auth-interrupts\#handling-tool-authorization)

When a tool requires user authorization, the agent receives a response with:

```nextra-code
{
  authorization_required: true,
  url: "https://auth.arcade.com/...",
  message: "Forward this url to the user for authorization"
}
```

Your agent should recognize this pattern and present the URL to the user. To create a better user experience:

- Display the authorization URL as a clickable link in your UI
- Explain which service needs authorization and why
- Provide a way for users to retry their request after authorization

## Tips for Selecting Tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/user-auth-interrupts\#tips-for-selecting-tools)

- **Focus on relevance**: Choose tools that directly support your agent’s specific purpose
- **Consider performance**: Some tools may have higher latency than others
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement robust error handling for third-party service failures
- **Create clear user flows**: Design intuitive authorization experiences

## Next Steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/user-auth-interrupts\#next-steps)

After integrating Arcade tools into your Mastra agent, you can:

- Add [memory capabilities](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/agent-memory) to maintain context between interactions
- Implement [structured workflows](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/overview) for complex multi-step operations
- Enhance your agent with [RAG capabilities](https://mastra.ai/docs/rag/overview) for domain-specific knowledge
- Set up [logging and tracing](https://mastra.ai/docs/observability/logging) to monitor performance

For more detailed information on Mastra’s capabilities, visit the [Mastra documentation](https://mastra.ai/docs).

## Agent Authorization Simplified
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") AuthorizationHow Arcade Helps

# How Arcade helps with Agent Authorization

### The challenges that Arcade solves [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps\#the-challenges-that-arcade-solves)

Applications that use models to perform tasks ( _agentic applications_) commonly require access to sensitive data and services. Authentication complexities often hinder AI from performing tasks that require user-specific information, like what emails you recently received or what’s coming up on your calendar.

To retrieve this information, agentic applications need to be able to authenticate and authorize access to external services you use like Gmail or Google Calendar.

Authenticating to retrieve information, however, is not the only challenge. Agentic applications also need to authenticate in order to **act** on your behalf - like sending an email or updating your calendar.

Without auth, AI agents are severely limited in what they can do.

### How Arcade solves this [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps\#how-arcade-solves-this)

Arcade provides an authorization system that handles OAuth 2.0, API keys, and user tokens needed by AI agents to access external services through tools. This means your AI agents can now act on behalf of users securely and privately.

With Arcade, developers can now create agents that can _act as the end users of their application_ to perform tasks like:

- Creating a new Zoom meeting
- Sending or reading email
- Answering questions about files in Google Drive.

### Auth permissions and scopes [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps\#auth-permissions-and-scopes)

Each tool in Arcade’s toolkits has a set of required permissions - or, more commonly referred to in OAuth2, **scopes**. For example, the [`Google.SendEmail`](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/gmail#sendemail) tool requires the [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#gmail) scope.

A scope is what the user has authorized someone else (in this case, the AI agent) to do on their behalf. In any OAuth2-compatible service, each kind of action requires a different set of permissions. This gives the user fine-grained control over what data third-party services can access and what actions can be executed in their accounts.

When a tool is called, the Arcade Engine will check if the user has granted the required permissions. If not, it will automatically prompt the user to authorize the tool, coordinating the OAuth2 flow with the service provider.

### How to implement OAuth2-authorized tool calling [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps\#how-to-implement-oauth2-authorized-tool-calling)

To learn how Arcade allows for actions (tools) to be authorized through OAuth2 and how to implement it, check out [Authorized Tool Calling](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/auth-tool-calling).

### Tools that don’t require authorization [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps\#tools-that-dont-require-authorization)

Some tools, like [`Search.SearchGoogle`](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/google_search#searchgoogle), allow AI agents to retrieve information or perform actions without needing user-specific authorization.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(api_key="arcade_api_key")  # or set the ARCADE_API_KEY env var

# Use the Search.SearchGoogle tool to perform a web search
response = await client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="Search.SearchGoogle",
    input={"query": "Latest AI advancements"},
)
print(response.output.value)
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(api_key="arcade_api_key");  // or set the ARCADE_API_KEY env var

// Use the Search.SearchGoogle tool to perform a web search
const response = await client.tools.execute({
  tool_name: "Search.SearchGoogle",
  input: { query: "Latest AI advancements" },
});
console.log(response.output.value);
```

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/dropbox/dropbox\#auth)

The Arcade Dropbox toolkit uses the [Dropbox auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox) to connect to users’ Dropbox accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there’s nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Dropbox auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox#configuring-dropbox-auth) with your own Dropbox app credentials.

## Local Toolkit Installation
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Local Deployment [Install](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview "Install") Toolkits

# Install a tool or toolkit

## Running a Local worker [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/toolkits\#running-a-local-worker)

To run a local worker without the arcade engine, you can run the following command locally:

```nextra-code
arcade serve
```

This will check for any toolkits installed in the current python virtual environment and register them with the worker.

You can also pass in the `--host` and `--port` flags to specify the host and port to run the worker on. The default host is `127.0.0.1` and the default port is `8002`.

## PyPI Installation [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/toolkits\#pypi-installation)

All Arcade toolkits are available on PyPI. To install a toolkit, run the following in the same python virtual environment as the arcade-ai package:

```nextra-code
pip install arcade-[toolkit_name]
```

For example, to install the math toolkit, run:

```nextra-code
pip install arcade-math
```

To verify the installation, run:

```nextra-code
arcade show --local
```

which should return output similar to:

```nextra-code
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name         ┃ Description                  ┃ Toolkit ┃ Version ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩
│ Math.Add     │ Add two numbers together     │  Math   │  0.1.0  │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

These are all tools that are installed in the same python virtual environment as the arcade-ai package.

See our [Toolkits Overview page](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits) for all available toolkits and individual installation instructions.

## Local Package Installation [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/toolkits\#local-package-installation)

Locally built toolkits can also be installed with:

```nextra-code
pip install .
```

or

```nextra-code
pip install <wheel_name>
```

in the same python virtual environment as the arcade-ai package.

## Hosted Toolkits [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/toolkits\#hosted-toolkits)

To add a toolkit to a hosted worker such as FastAPI, you can register them in the worker itself. This allows you to explicitly define which tools should be included on a particular worker.

```nextra-code
import arcade_math
from fastapi import FastAPI
from arcade_tdk import Toolkit
from arcade_serve.fastapi import FastAPIWorker

app = FastAPI()

worker_secret = os.environ.get("ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET")
worker = FastAPIWorker(app, secret=worker_secret)

worker.register_toolkit(Toolkit.from_module(arcade_math))
```

## Showing Tools From a Hosted Engine [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/toolkits\#showing-tools-from-a-hosted-engine)

To show all tools that are available on an engine, you can run

```nextra-code
arcade show -h <engine_host> -p <engine_port>
```

```nextra-code

## Arcade FAQ
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") FAQ

# Frequently Asked Questions

## What if I need a Tool that Arcade doesn’t have? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/faq\#what-if-i-need-a-tool-that-arcade-doesnt-have)

Arcade makes it easy to build your own tools! You can fork our existing tools, or build your own from scratch. Learn more about [building your own toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).

## How do I contribute back a Tool to the Registry? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/faq\#how-do-i-contribute-back-a-tool-to-the-registry)

We’re always looking for new tools and toolkits! If you have a tool that you think would be useful to others, please let us know. You can contribute a tool by submitting a pull request to the [Arcade GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai).

## What is the difference between the Arcade CLI and the Arcade Clients? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/faq\#what-is-the-difference-between-the-arcade-cli-and-the-arcade-clients)

The [Arcade CLI](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/arcade-cli) is a command line tool that makes it easy to build, test, and deploy your own tools to production. The [Arcade Client libraries](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/arcade-clients) are what you will use within your own agents and applications to call the tools.

## How does Arcade.dev relate to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/faq\#how-does-arcadedev-relate-to-the-model-context-protocol-mcp)

The Arcade.dev engine both speaks MCP and extends it with an authentication-first architecture. This means that you can use Arcade.dev to build tools that can be called by any LLM that supports MCP, while also providing a secure and easy way to authenticate users and manage access to those tools. Learn more about [Arcade.dev and MCP](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-overview).

## Auth FAQ [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/faq\#auth-faq)

### What is the difference between adding an included provider and adding a custom provider? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/faq\#what-is-the-difference-between-adding-an-included-provider-and-adding-a-custom-provider)

This is an important observation. Technically, both included and custom providers are OAuth providers. However, when you add an included provider, the Arcade Engine requires less information from you to configure the provider, because it can use the values defined by that provider on their official documentation. Also, most importantly, the Engine will automatically route tools so they connect to the added provider.

### Can my users connect multiple accounts of the same provider? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/faq\#can-my-users-connect-multiple-accounts-of-the-same-provider)

Today this is possible if you assign multiple Arcade `user_id` s to the same user on your system. You will need to manage the mapping between users in your system and the different Arcade `user_id` s assigned to them.

### Can I authenticate multiple tools at once? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/faq\#can-i-authenticate-multiple-tools-at-once)

Yes, as long as they are from the same OAuth provider. You need to collect all
the scopes required by the tools you need, and then authenticate with that
provider with all these scopes. For example, for [Google\\
Tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google), you can use this code to authenticate once:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade() # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable
USER_ID = "you@example.com"

# get the list of tools
tools = client.tools.list(toolkit="Google")

# collect the scopes
scopes = set()
for tool in tools:
    if tool.requirements.authorization.oauth2.scopes:
        scopes |= set(tool.requirements.authorization.oauth2.scopes)

# start auth
auth_response = client.auth.start(user_id=USER_ID, scopes=list(scopes), provider="google")


# show the url to the user if needed
if auth_response.status != "complete":
    print(f"Please click here to authorize: {auth_response.url}")
    # Wait for the authorization to complete
    client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

```

```nextra-code
import Arcade from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();
const user_id = "user@example.com";

// get the list of tools
const googleToolkit = await client.tools.list({toolkit: "google"})

// collect scopes
const scopes = new Set(googleToolkit.items.flatMap(i => i.requirements?.authorization?.oauth2?.scopes ?? []));

// start authentication
let auth_response = await client.auth.start(user_id, "google", {
    scopes:[...scopes]
});

// show the url to the user if needed
if (auth_response.status !== "completed") {
    console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
    console.log(auth_response.url);
    // Wait for the authorization to complete
    auth_response = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(auth_response);
}
```

- **Easy integration** with the Google ADK framework
- **Access to all Arcade toolkits** including Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, X, and more
- **Create custom tools** with the Arcade Tool SDK
- **Manage user authentication** for tools that require it
- **Asynchronous support** compatible with Google’s ADK framework

## Basic usage [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/overview\#basic-usage)

Here’s a simple example of using Arcade tools with OpenAI Agents:

```nextra-code
import asyncio

from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
from google.adk import Agent, Runner
from google.adk.artifacts import InMemoryArtifactService
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.genai import types

from google_adk_arcade.tools import get_arcade_tools


async def main():
    app_name = 'my_app'
    user_id = 'user@example.com'
    session_service = InMemorySessionService()
    artifact_service = InMemoryArtifactService()
    client = AsyncArcade()

    google_tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, tools=["Google.ListEmails"])

    # authorize the tools
    for tool in google_tools:
        result = await client.tools.authorize(
            tool_name=tool.name,
            user_id=user_id
        )
        if result.status != "completed":
            print(f"Click this link to authorize {tool.name}:\n{result.url}")
        await client.auth.wait_for_completion(result)

    # create the agent
    google_agent = Agent(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        name="google_tool_agent",
        instruction="I can use Google tools to manage an inbox!",
        description="An agent equipped with tools to read Gmail emails."
        tools=google_tools,
    )

    #create the session and pass the user ID to the state
    session = await session_service.create_session(
        app_name=app_name, user_id=user_id, state={
            "user_id": user_id,
        }
    )

    runner = Runner(
        app_name=app_name,
        agent=google_agent,
        artifact_service=artifact_service,
        session_service=session_service,
    )

    user_input = "summarize my latest 3 emails"
    content = types.Content(
        role='user', parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=user_input)]
    )
    for event in runner.run(
        user_id=user_id,
        session_id=session.id,
        new_message=content,
    ):
        if event.content.parts and event.content.parts[0].text:
            print(f'** {event.author}: {event.content.parts[0].text}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Handling authorization [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/overview\#handling-authorization)

When a user needs to authorize access to a tool (like Google or GitHub),
the agent will reply with a URL for the user to visit, which will be displayed
to the user.

After visiting the URL and authorizing access, the user can run the agent again
with the same `user_id`, and it will work without requiring re-authorization.

Alternatively, you can authorize the tool before running the agent:

```nextra-code
# authorize the tools
for tool in google_tools:
    result = await client.tools.authorize(
        tool_name=tool.name,
        user_id=user_id
    )
    if result.status != "completed":
        print(f"Click this link to authorize {tool.name}:\n{result.url}")
    await client.auth.wait_for_completion(result)
```

## Available toolkits [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/overview\#available-toolkits)

Arcade provides a variety of toolkits you can use with your agents:

- **Google Suite**: Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs
- **Social Media**: LinkedIn, X
- **Development**: GitHub
- **Web**: Web search, content extraction
- **And more**: Weather, financial data, etc.

For a full list of available toolkits, visit the [Arcade Integrations](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits) documentation.

## Create Evaluation Suite
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Evaluate tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools "Evaluate tools") Create an evaluation suite

# Evaluate tools

In this guide, you’ll learn how to evaluate your custom tools to ensure they function correctly with the AI assistant, including defining evaluation cases and using different critics.

We’ll create evaluation cases to test our `hello` tool and measure its performance.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#prerequisites)

- [Build a custom tool](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit)
- Install the evaluation dependencies:

uvpip

```nextra-code
uv pip install 'arcade-ai[evals]'
```

```nextra-code
pip install 'arcade-ai[evals]'
```

### Create an evaluation suite [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#create-an-evaluation-suite)

Navigate to your toolkit’s `evals` directory:

```nextra-code
cd arcade_my_new_toolkit/evals
```

Create a new Python file for your evaluations, e.g., `eval_hello.py`.

### Define your evaluation cases [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#define-your-evaluation-cases)

Open `eval_hello.py` and add the following code:

```nextra-code
from arcade_evals import (
    EvalSuite,
    EvalRubric,
    ExpectedToolCall,
    BinaryCritic,
    tool_eval,
)
from arcade_tdk import ToolCatalog
from arcade_my_new_toolkit.tools.hello import hello

# Create a catalog of tools to include in the evaluation
catalog = ToolCatalog()
catalog.add_tool(hello)

# Define the evaluation rubric
rubric = EvalRubric(
    fail_threshold=0.8,
    warn_threshold=0.9,
)

@tool_eval()
def hello_eval_suite() -> EvalSuite:
    """Create an evaluation suite for the hello tool."""
    suite = EvalSuite(
        name="Hello Tool Evaluation",
        system_message="You are a helpful assistant.",
        catalog=catalog,
        rubric=rubric,
    )

    # Example evaluation case
    suite.add_case(
        name="Simple Greeting",
        user_message="Say hello to Alice",
        expected_tool_calls=[\
            ExpectedToolCall(\
                func=hello,\
                args={\
                    "name": "Alice",\
                },\
            )\
        ],
        critics=[\
            BinaryCritic(critic_field="name", weight=1.0),\
        ],
    )

    return suite
```

### Run the evaluation [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#run-the-evaluation)

From the `evals` directory, run:

```nextra-code
arcade evals .
```

This command executes your evaluation suite and provides a report.

### How it works [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#how-it-works)

The evaluation framework in Arcade allows you to define test cases ( `EvalCase`) with expected tool calls and use critics to assess the AI’s performance.

By running the evaluation suite, you can measure how well the AI assistant is using your tools.

### Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#next-steps)

Explore different types of critics and evaluation criteria to thoroughly test your tools.

[Learn more about Critic classes](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite#critic-classes)

## Critic classes [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#critic-classes)

Arcade provides several critic classes to evaluate different aspects of tool usage.

### BinaryCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#binarycritic)

Checks if a parameter value matches exactly.

```nextra-code
BinaryCritic(critic_field="name", weight=1.0)
```

### SimilarityCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#similaritycritic)

Evaluates the similarity between expected and actual values.

```nextra-code
from arcade_evals import SimilarityCritic

SimilarityCritic(critic_field="message", weight=1.0)
```

### NumericCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#numericcritic)

Assesses numeric values within a specified tolerance.

```nextra-code
from arcade_evals import NumericCritic

NumericCritic(critic_field="score", tolerance=0.1, weight=1.0)
```

### DatetimeCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#datetimecritic)

Evaluates the closeness of datetime values within a specified tolerance.

```nextra-code
from datetime import timedelta
from arcade_evals import DatetimeCritic

DatetimeCritic(critic_field="start_time", tolerance=timedelta(seconds=10), weight=1.0)
```

## Advanced evaluation cases [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#advanced-evaluation-cases)

You can add more evaluation cases to test different scenarios.

### Example: Greeting with emotion [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/create-an-evaluation-suite\#example-greeting-with-emotion)

Modify your `hello` tool to accept an `emotion` parameter:

```nextra-code
from arcade_tdk import tool
from typing import Annotated

class Emotion(str, Enum):
    HAPPY = "happy"
    SLIGHTLY_HAPPY = "slightly happy"
    SAD = "sad"
    SLIGHTLY_SAD = "slightly sad"

@tool
def hello(
    name: Annotated[str, "The name of the person to greet"] = "there",
    emotion: Annotated[Emotion, "The emotion to convey"] = Emotion.HAPPY
) -> Annotated[str, "A greeting to the user"]:
    """
    Say hello to the user with a specific emotion.
    """
    return f"Hello {name}! I'm feeling {emotion.value} today."
```

Add an evaluation case for this new parameter:

## Spotify Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Spotify

# Spotify auth provider

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Spotify Auth Provider. To use
Spotify auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Spotify
OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Spotify auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Spotify API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Spotify auth provider seamlessly manage Spotify OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Spotify auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify#using-spotify-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Spotify APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify#using-spotify-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Spotify APIs

## Configuring Spotify auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#configuring-spotify-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Spotify app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Spotify credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Spotify app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Spotify app.

### Create a Spotify app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#create-a-spotify-app)

- Follow Spotify’s guide to [registering an app](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)
- Choose the “Web API” product (at a minimum)
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Spotify app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Spotify Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#configuring-your-own-spotify-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Spotify app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Spotify Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Spotify**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-spotify-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Spotify app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Spotify auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Spotify OAuth provider. If you have multiple Spotify providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Spotify auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `spotify` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-spotify
      description: "The default Spotify provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: spotify
      client_id: ${env:SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using Spotify auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#using-spotify-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Spotify auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Spotify API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Spotify API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="spotify",
    scopes=["user-read-playback-state"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "spotify", [\
  "user-read-playback-state",\
]);

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Spotify auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/spotify\#using-spotify-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Spotify API.

Use the `Spotify()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Spotify. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Spotify token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Spotify


@tool(
    requires_auth=Spotify(
        scopes=["user-read-playback-state"],
    )
)
async def get_playback_state(
    context: ToolContext,
) -> Annotated[dict, "Information about the user's current playback state"]:
    """Get information about the user's current playback state, including track or episode, progress, and active device."""
    endpoint = "/me/player"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(
            f"https://api.spotify.com/v1/{endpoint}",
            headers=headers,
        )
        response.raise_for_status()

        if response.status_code == 204:
            return {"status": "Playback not available or active"}
        return response.json()
```

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/development/github/github\#auth)

The Arcade GitHub toolkit uses the [GitHub auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github) to connect to users’ GitHub accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there’s nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the GitHub auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github#configuring-github-auth) with your own GitHub app credentials.

To change the toolkits, edit the `toolkits` list in the `run-arcade-worker.py` file.

### Example `run-arcade-worker.py` [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/modal-worker\#example-run-arcade-workerpy)

```nextra-code
import os
from modal import App, Image, asgi_app

# Define the FastAPI app
app = App("arcade-worker")

toolkits = ["arcade-google", "arcade-slack"]

image = (
    Image.debian_slim()
    .pip_install("arcade_tdk")
    .pip_install("arcade_serve")
    .pip_install(toolkits)
)

@app.function(image=image)
@asgi_app()
def fastapi_app():
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from arcade_tdk import Toolkit
    from arcade_serve.fastapi import FastAPIWorker

    web_app = FastAPI()

    # Initialize app and Arcade FastAPIWorker
    worker_secret = os.environ.get("ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET", "dev")
    worker = FastAPIWorker(web_app, secret=worker_secret)

    # Register toolkits we've installed
    installed_toolkits = Toolkit.find_all_arcade_toolkits()
    for toolkit in toolkits:
        if toolkit in installed_toolkits:
            worker.register_toolkit(toolkit)

    return web_app
```

### Connect to Arcade Engine [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/modal-worker\#connect-to-arcade-engine)

## Create Tool with Secrets
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Build tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit "Build tools") Create a tool with secrets

# Create a tool with secrets

In this guide, you’ll learn how to use secrets in your custom Arcade tools.

Secrets are sensitive strings like passwords, api-keys, or other tokens that grant access to a protected resource or API. Although you could use secrets to transfer any static information to your tool, such as a parameter needed to call a remote API.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-secrets\#prerequisites)

- [Set up Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/quickstart)
- [Create a toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit)
- [Understand Tool Context](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/tool-context)

### Set the secret in the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-secrets\#set-the-secret-in-the-arcade-dashboard)

Go to the [Auth > Secrets section](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/secrets) in the Arcade Dashboard.

![An image showing how the Arcade UI allows users to manage secrets](https://docs.arcade.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsecrets-dashboard-2.eb90edeb.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7X7SFSaKe9V7iRHd3Et4a6gD5tMs)

In the top-right corner, click the **\+ Add Secret** button and enter:

- **ID**: `MY_SECRET_INFO`
- **Secret Value**: `my-secret-value`
- **Description**: optionally add a description

Click **Submit** to save the secret.

### Define your tool and access the secret [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-secrets\#define-your-tool-and-access-the-secret)

Use the `@tool` decorator to define the secret requirement. The `context` object has a `get_secret` method that you can use to access the secret value.

```nextra-code
from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool

@tool(requires_secrets=["MY_SECRET_INFO"])
def my_tool_using_secret(context: ToolContext) -> str:
    secret_value = context.get_secret("MY_SECRET_INFO")
    return f"The secret value is {secret_value}"
```

When your tool is executed, it will return: `"The secret value is my-secret-value"`. In a real world application, you would use this secret to connect to a remote database, API, etc.

## Atlassian Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Atlassian

# Atlassian auth provider

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Atlassian Auth Provider. To use
Atlassian auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Atlassian
OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Atlassian auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Atlassian API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Atlassian auth provider seamlessly manage Atlassian OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Atlassian auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian#using-atlassian-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Atlassian APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian#using-atlassian-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Atlassian APIs

## Configuring Atlassian auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#configuring-atlassian-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Atlassian app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Atlassian credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Atlassian app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create an Atlassian app.

### Create an Atlassian app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#create-an-atlassian-app)

- Create a Atlassian app in the [Atlassian developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)
- In the Authorization tab, click the “Add” action button and set the Callback URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the Permissions tab, enable any permissions you need for your app
- In the Settings tab, copy the Client ID and Secret to use below

## Configuring your own Atlassian Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#configuring-your-own-atlassian-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Atlassian app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Atlassian Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Atlassian**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-atlassian-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Atlassian app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Atlassian auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Atlassian OAuth provider. If you have multiple Atlassian providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Atlassian auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `atlassian` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-atlassian
      description: "The default Atlassian provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: atlassian
      client_id: ${env:ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET}

## Using Atlassian auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#using-atlassian-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Atlassian auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Atlassian API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Atlassian API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="atlassian",
    scopes=["read:me", "read:jira-user", "read:confluence-user"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "atlassian", {
  scopes: ["read:me", "read:jira-user", "read:confluence-user"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Atlassian auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/atlassian\#using-atlassian-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Atlassian API.

Use the `Atlassian()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Atlassian. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Atlassian token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Atlassian


@tool(
    requires_auth=Atlassian(
        scopes=["read:jira-work"],
    )
)
async def list_projects(
    context: ToolContext,
    query: Annotated[\
        Optional[str],\
        "The query to filter the projects by. Defaults to empty string to list all projects.",\
    ] = "",
) -> Annotated[dict, "The list of projects in a user's Jira instance"]:
    """List a Jira user's projects."""
    url = f"https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>/rest/api/3/project/search?query={query}"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

## Arcade Engine Configuration
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Local Deployment](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install "Local Deployment") [Configure](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/overview "Configure") Engine

# Arcade Engine configuration

Arcade Engine’s configuration is a [YAML file](https://yaml.org/) with the following sections:

| Section | Description |
| --- | --- |
| API Configuration | Configures the server for specific protocols |
| Auth Configuration | Configures user authorization providers and token storage |
| Cache Configuration | Configures the short-lived cache |
| Security Configuration | Configures security and encryption |
| Storage Configuration | Configures persistent storage |
| Telemetry Configuration | Configures telemetry and observability (OTEL) |
| Tools Configuration | Configures tools for AI models to use |

## Specify a config file [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#specify-a-config-file)

To start the Arcade Engine, pass a config file with `-c` or `--config`:

```nextra-code
arcade-engine -c /path/to/config.yaml
```

Ensure you have a worker running before starting the engine. See [arcade serve CLI command](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/arcade-cli#arcade-serve) for how to start a worker via the CLI.

## Dotenv files [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#dotenv-files)

Arcade Engine automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files in the directory where it was called. Use the `-e` or `--env` flag to specify a path:

```nextra-code
arcade-engine -e .env.dev -c config.yaml
```

## Secrets [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#secrets)

Arcade Engine supports two ways of passing sensitive information like API keys without storing them directly in the config file.

Environment variables:

```nextra-code
topic:
  area:
    - id: primary
      vendor:
        api_key: ${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

External files (useful in cloud setups):

```nextra-code
topic:
  area:
    - id: primary
      vendor:
        api_key: ${file:/path/to/secret}
```

## API configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#api-configuration)

HTTP is the supported protocol for Arcade Engine’s API. The following configuration options are available:

- `api.development` _(optional, default: `false`)_ \- Enable development mode, with more logging and simple [worker authentication](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine#http-worker-configuration)
- `api.http.host` _(default: `localhost`)_ \- Address to which Arcade Engine binds its server (e.g., `localhost` or `0.0.0.0`)
- `api.http.read_timeout` _(optional, default: `30s`)_ \- Timeout for reading data from clients
- `api.http.write_timeout` _(optional, default: `1m`)_ \- Timeout for writing data to clients
- `api.http.idle_timeout` _(optional, default: `30s`)_ \- Timeout for idle connections
- `api.http.max_request_body_size` _(optional, default: `4Mb`)_ \- Maximum request body size

A typical configuration for production looks like:

```nextra-code
api:
  development: false
  host: localhost
  port: 9099
```

For local development, set `api.development = true`. In development mode, Arcade Engine does not require [worker authentication](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine#http-worker-configuration).

## Auth configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#auth-configuration)

Arcade Engine manages auth for [AI tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/auth-tool-calling) and [direct API calls](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly). It supports many built-in [auth providers](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers), and can also connect to any [OAuth 2.0](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2) authorization server.

The `auth.providers` section defines the providers that users can authorize with. Each provider must have a unique `id` in the array. There are two ways to configure a provider:

For [built-in providers](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers), use the `provider_id` field to reference the pre-built configuration. For example:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-github
      description: The default GitHub provider
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: github
      client_id: ${env:GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

For custom OAuth 2.0 providers, specify the full connection details in the `oauth2` sub-section. For full documentation on the custom provider configuration, see the [OAuth 2.0 provider configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2) page.

You can specify a mix of built-in and custom providers.

## Cache configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#cache-configuration)

The `cache` section configures the short-lived cache.

Configuring the cache is optional. If not configured, the cache will default to an in-memory cache implementation suitable for a single-node Arcade Engine deployment.

The `cache` section has the following configuration options:

- `api_key_ttl` _(optional, default: `10s`)_ \- The time-to-live for API keys in the cache

Two cache implementations are available:

- `in_memory` \- _(default)_ An in-memory cache implementation suitable for a single-node Arcade Engine deployment.
- `redis` \- A Redis cache implementation suitable for a multi-node Arcade Engine deployment:

```nextra-code
cache:
  api_key_ttl: 10s
  redis:
    addr: 'localhost:6379'
    password: ''
    db: 0
```

## Security configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#security-configuration)

The `security` section configures the root encryption keys that the Arcade Engine uses to encrypt and decrypt data at rest. See the [storage configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine#storage-configuration) section below to configure where data is stored.

A typical configuration looks like this:

```nextra-code
security:
  root_keys:
    - id: key1
      default: true
      value: ${env:ROOT_KEY_1}
```

Keys should be a long random string of characters. For example:

```nextra-code
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Default root key [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#default-root-key)

When you [install Arcade Engine locally](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local), an `engine.env` file is created with a default root key:

```nextra-code
# Encryption keys (change this when deploying to production)
ROOT_KEY_1=default-key-value
```

This default value can only be used in development mode (see [API configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine#api-configuration) above).

You **must** replace the value of `ROOT_KEY_1` in `engine.env` before deploying to production.

## Storage configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#storage-configuration)

The `storage` section configures the storage backend that the Arcade Engine uses to store persistent data.

There are three storage implementations available:

- `in_memory` \- _(default)_ An in-memory database, suitable for testing.
- `sqlite` \- A SQLite file on disk, suitable for local development:

```nextra-code
storage:
  sqlite:
    # Stores DB in ~/.arcade/arcade-engine.sqlite3
    connection_string: '@ARCADE_HOME/arcade-engine.sqlite3'
```

- `postgres` \- A PostgreSQL database, suitable for production:

```nextra-code
storage:
  postgres:
    user: ${env:POSTGRES_USER}
    password: ${env:POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    host: ${env:POSTGRES_HOST}
    port: ${env:POSTGRES_PORT}
    db: ${env:POSTGRES_DB}
    sslmode: require
```

## Telemetry configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#telemetry-configuration)

Arcade supports logs, metrics, and traces with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).

If you are using the Arcade Engine locally, you can set the `environment` field to `local`. This will only output logs to the console:

```nextra-code
telemetry:
  environment: local
  logging:
    # debug, info, warn, error, fatal
    level: debug
    encoding: console
```

To connect to OpenTelemetry compatible collectors, set the necessary [OpenTelemetry environment variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/) in the `engine.env` file.
`environment` and `version` are fields that are added to the telemetry attributes, which can be filtered on later.

```nextra-code
telemetry:
  environment: prod
  logging:
    level: info
    encoding: console
```

### Notes [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#notes)

- The Engine service name is set to `arcade_engine`
- Traces currently cover the `/v1/health` endpoints, as well as authentication attempts

## Tools configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#tools-configuration)

Arcade Engine orchestrates [tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/tools-overview) that AI models can use. Tools are executed by distributed workers called **workers**, which are grouped into **directors**.

The `tools.directors` section configures the workers that are available to service tool calls:

```nextra-code
tools:
  directors:
    - id: default
      enabled: true
      max_tools: 64
      workers:
        - id: local_worker
          enabled: true
          http:
            uri: 'http://localhost:8002'
            timeout: 30
            retry: 3
```

When a worker is added to an enabled director, all of the tools hosted by that worker will be available to the model and through the Arcade API.

### HTTP worker configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine\#http-worker-configuration)

The `http` sub-section configures the HTTP client used to call the worker’s tools:

- `uri` _(required)_ \- The base URL of the worker’s tools
- `secret` _(required)_ \- Secret used to authenticate with the worker
- `timeout` _(optional, default: `30s`)_ \- Timeout for calling the worker’s tools
- `retry` _(optional, default: `3`)_ \- Number of times to retry a failed tool call

Workers must be configured with a `secret` that is used to authenticate with
the worker. This ensures that workers are not exposed to the public internet
without security.

If `api.development = true`, the secret will default to `"dev"` for local development **only**. In production, the secret must be set to a random value.

## Hubspot Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Hubspot

# Hubspot auth provider

The Hubspot auth provider enables tools and agents to call Hubspot APIs on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Hubspot auth provider seamlessly manage Hubspot OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

Want to quickly get started with Hubspot services in your agent or AI app? The
pre-built [Arcade Hubspot toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/hubspot) is what you want!

## What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Hubspot auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Hubspot toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/hubspot), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Hubspot
- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot#using-hubspot-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Hubspot APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot#using-hubspot-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Hubspot APIs

## Use Arcade’s Default Hubspot Auth Provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#use-arcades-default-hubspot-auth-provider)

Arcade offers a default Hubspot auth provider that you can use in the Arcade Cloud. In this case, your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

If you choose to use Arcade’s Hubspot auth, you don’t need to configure anything. Follow the [Hubspot toolkit examples](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/hubspot) to get started calling Hubspot tools.

## Use Your Own Hubspot App Credentials [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#use-your-own-hubspot-app-credentials)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Hubspot app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Hubspot credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Hubspot app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Hubspot app.

## Create a Hubspot App [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#create-a-hubspot-app)

Hubspot has two types of apps: Public and Private. You will need to create a Public one.

Follow [Hubspot’s tutorial](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/public-apps/overview) to create your Public App. You will need a [developer account](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers) to do this.

When creating your app, use the following settings:

- Under **App Info**, choose a name, description, and logo for your app
- Under **Auth**, enter the **Redirect URL**: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the **Scopes** section, click **Add Scope** and add the following scopes with the **Conditionally Required** scope type:
  - `crm.objects.companies.read`
  - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
  - `crm.objects.contacts.write`
  - `crm.objects.deals.read`
  - `sales-email-read`

Create the app and take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You don’t need to follow Hubspot’s instructions to install the app.

If you are implementing your own [Hubspot custom\\
tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot#using-hubspot-auth-in-custom-tools), make sure to also add [any extra\\
scopes](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/authentication/scopes)
necessary for the actions your tools need to perform. All extra scopes must be
added to the app as `Conditionally Required` or `Optional`, never as
`Required`, otherwise the Arcade Hubspot toolkit will not work. Read more
about [Hubspot scope\\
types](https://developers.hubspot.com/changelog/advanced-auth-and-scope-settings-for-public-apps).

## Configuring your own Hubspot Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#configuring-your-own-hubspot-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Hubspot app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (only possible with a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Hubspot Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Hubspot**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Enter `hubspot` as the **ID** for your provider
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Hubspot app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Hubspot auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Hubspot OAuth provider. If you have multiple Hubspot providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configure Hubspot Auth Using the Engine Configuration YAML

Refer to [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information
on how to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

#### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

#### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

To locate the `engine.yaml` file in your OS after installing the Arcade
Engine, check the [Engine configuration\\
file](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/overview#engine-configuration-file) documentation.

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a Hubspot item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: hubspot
      description: "Custom Hubspot provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      client_id: ${env:HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

#### Restart the Arcade Engine [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#restart-the-arcade-engine)

If the Arcade Engine is already running, you will need to restart it for the changes to take effect.

## Using the Arcade Hubspot Toolkit [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#using-the-arcade-hubspot-toolkit)

The [Arcade Hubspot toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/hubspot) provides tools to interact with various Hubspot objects, such as companies, contacts, deals, and email messages.

Refer to the [toolkit documentation and examples](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/hubspot) to learn how to use the toolkit to build agents and AI apps that interact with Hubspot services.

## Using Hubspot auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#using-hubspot-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Hubspot auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Hubspot API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Hubspot API:

PythonJavaScript

If you are [self-hosting Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview), change the `base_url` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(base_url="https://api.arcade.dev")  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="hubspot",
    scopes=["oauth", "crm.objects.companies.read"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

If you are [self-hosting Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview), change the `baseURL` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade({ baseURL: "https://api.arcade.dev" }); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "hubspot", {
  scopes: ["oauth", "crm.objects.companies.read"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
const response = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = response.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

You can use the auth token to call [Hubspot Companies endpoints](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/api/crm/objects/companies) and read information about companies. By changing or adding scopes to the `client.auth.start` call, you can call other Hubspot endpoints.

The scopes supported by the Arcade Hubspot auth provider are the ones [listed above](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot#create-a-hubspot-app). If you created your own Hubspot app, make sure to add the scopes you intend to use in the `client.auth.start` call.

## Using Hubspot auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/hubspot\#using-hubspot-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Hubspot API.

Use the `Hubspot()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Hubspot. The authentication token needed to call the Hubspot API is available in the tool context through the `context.get_auth_token_or_empty()` method.

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Hubspot


@tool(
    requires_auth=Hubspot(
        scopes=["oauth", "crm.objects.companies.read"],
    )
)
async def get_company_details(
    context: ToolContext,
    company_id: Annotated[\
        str,\
        "The ID of the company to get the details of.",\
    ],
) -> Annotated[dict, "Details of the company"]:
    """Gets the details of a company."""
    url = f"https://api.hubapi.com/crm//v3/objects/companies/{company_id}"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.get_auth_token_or_empty()}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

If you are [self-hosting Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview), you will need to restart the Arcade Worker and the Engine for the new tool to be available.

Your new tool can be called like demonstrated below:

PythonJavaScript

If you are self-hosting, change the `base_url` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(base_url="https://api.arcade.dev")  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

USER_ID = "user@example.com"
TOOL_NAME = "Hubspot.GetCompanyDetails"

auth_response = client.tools.authorize(tool_name=TOOL_NAME, user_id=USER_ID)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print(f"Click this link to authorize: {auth_response.url}")

# Wait for the authorization to complete
client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

tool_input = {
    "company_id": "32134490789",
}

response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name=TOOL_NAME,
    input=tool_input,
    user_id=USER_ID,
)
print(response.output.value)
```

If you are self-hosting, change the `baseURL` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade({ baseURL: "https://api.arcade.dev" }); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const USER_ID = "user@example.com";
const TOOL_NAME = "Hubspot.GetCompanyDetails";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.tools.authorize({
  tool_name: TOOL_NAME,
  user_id: USER_ID,
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log(`Click this link to authorize: ${authResponse.url}`);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const toolInput = {
  company_id: "1234567890",
};

const response = await client.tools.execute({
  tool_name: TOOL_NAME,
  input: toolInput,
  user_id: USER_ID,
});

console.log(response.output.value);
```

## Zoom Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Zoom

# Zoom auth provider

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Zoom Auth Provider. To use Zoom
auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Zoom OAuth 2.0
credentials as described below.

The Zoom auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Zoom API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Zoom auth provider seamlessly manage Zoom OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Zoom auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom#using-zoom-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Zoom APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom#using-zoom-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Zoom APIs

## Configuring Zoom auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#configuring-zoom-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Zoom app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Zoom credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Zoom app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Zoom app.

### Create a Zoom app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#create-a-zoom-app)

- Follow Zoom’s guide to [registering an app](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/create/) on the Zoom marketplace
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback` and enable Strict Mode
- Enable the Zoom features and permissions (scopes) that your app needs
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Zoom app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Zoom Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#configuring-your-own-zoom-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Zoom app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Zoom Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Zoom**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-zoom-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Zoom app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Zoom auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Zoom OAuth provider. If you have multiple Zoom providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Zoom auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `zoom` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-zoom
      description: "The default Zoom provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: zoom
      client_id: ${env:ZOOM_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using Zoom auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#using-zoom-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Zoom auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Zoom API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Zoom API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="zoom",
    scopes=["meeting:read:list_upcoming_meetings"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "zoom", [\
  "meeting:read:list_upcoming_meetings",\
]);

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Zoom auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom\#using-zoom-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Zoom API.

Use the `Zoom()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Zoom. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Zoom token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Zoom


@tool(
    requires_auth=Zoom(
        scopes=["meeting:read:list_upcoming_meetings"],
    )
)
async def list_upcoming_meetings(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_id: Annotated[\
        Optional[str],\
        "The user's user ID or email address. Defaults to 'me' for the current user.",\
    ] = "me",
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of upcoming meetings within the next 24 hours"]:
    """List a Zoom user's upcoming meetings within the next 24 hours."""
    url = f"https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/{user_id}/upcoming_meetings"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

## OAuth 2.0 Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") OAuth 2.0

# OAuth 2.0 auth provider

The OAuth 2.0 auth provider enables tools and agents to authorize with any OAuth 2.0-compatible API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and this auth provider seamlessly manage OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

Arcade has [pre-built integrations](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers) with many popular
OAuth 2.0 providers. Use this OAuth 2.0 provider to connect to other systems
that aren’t pre-built.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to configure OAuth 2.0 with Arcade, and use it in:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2#using-oauth-20-in-app-code) that needs to call APIs protected by OAuth 2.0
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2#using-oauth-20-in-custom-tools) that need to call APIs protected by OAuth 2.0

### Supported OAuth 2.0 flows [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#supported-oauth-20-flows)

The only supported OAuth 2.0 flow is the authorization code grant flow (with or without PKCE).

## Configuring OAuth 2.0 [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#configuring-oauth-20)

How you configure the OAuth 2.0 provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview). If you use the Cloud Engine, you must configure your provider in the Dashboard.

When configuring your app in the OAuth 2.0 enabled service, you must use `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback` as the redirect URL (sometimes called callback URL).

### Using the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#using-the-arcade-dashboard)

When using the Arcade Cloud, the Dashboard is available at [`https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard`](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are [self-hosting Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview), by default the Dashboard is available at [`http://localhost:9099/dashboard`](http://localhost:9099/dashboard). Adjust the host and port, if necessary, to match your environment.

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **OAuth 2.0** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-oauth2-provider”) with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your OAuth 2.0 provider.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require OAuth 2.0 authorization using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this OAuth 2.0 provider.

### Using the `engine.yaml` configuration file [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#using-the-engineyaml-configuration-file)

This method is only available when you are [self-hosting the engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview)

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables. Replace `HOOLI` with the name of the OAuth 2.0 provider you are configuring:

```nextra-code
export HOOLI_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export HOOLI_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
HOOLI_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
HOOLI_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

See [configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how to set
environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

To locate the `engine.yaml` file in your OS after installing the Arcade Engine, check the [Engine configuration file](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/overview#engine-configuration-file) documentation.

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a new item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-github
      description: The default GitHub provider
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: github
      client_id: ${env:GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}

    - id: hooli
      description: Hooli OAuth 2.0 provider
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      client_id: ${env:HOOLI_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:HOOLI_CLIENT_SECRET}
      oauth2:
        # For a custom OAuth 2.0 provider, specify the full OAuth configuration:
```

The ID of the provider ( `hooli` in this example) can be any string. It’s used to reference the provider in your app code and must be unique.

Each service expects a slightly different set of values in the `oauth2` section. Refer to the configuration reference below, and to your service’s documentation to understand what values are required.

If you need help configuring a specific provider, [get in touch with\\
us](mailto:contact@arcade.dev)!

### Configuration reference [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#configuration-reference)

For a full example, see the [full configuration example](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2#full-configuration-example) below.

`scope_delimiter` _(optional, defaults to the space character)_: The delimiter to use between scopes.

`pkce` _(optional)_:

- `enabled` _(optional, default `false`)_: If `true`, PKCE will be used.
- `code_challenge_method` _(optional, default `S256`)_: The code challenge method to use. The only supported method is `S256`. This parameter is ignored if PKCE is not enabled.

#### `authorize_request` [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#authorize_request)

This section configures the initial authorization request.

- `endpoint`: The authorization endpoint for your OAuth 2.0 server, e.g. `/oauth2/authorize`
- `params`: A map of parameter keys and values to include in the authorization request.

These placeholders are available in `params`:

- `{{client_id}}`: The configured client ID.
- `{{redirect_uri}}`: The redirect URI managed by Arcade.
- `{{scopes}}`: The scopes to request, if any
- `{{existing_scopes}}`: The scopes that the user has already granted, if any.

The `state` parameter is automatically added to the request, and does not need
to be included in `params`. If PKCE is enabled, `code_challenge` and
`code_challenge_method` are also added automatically.

For most providers, `oauth2.authorize_request` will look like:

```nextra-code
authorize_request:
  endpoint: 'https://example.com/oauth2/authorize'
  params:
    response_type: code
    client_id: '{{client_id}}'
    redirect_uri: '{{redirect_uri}}'
    scope: '{{scopes}} {{existing_scopes}}'
```

Some providers support additional parameters in the authorization request. These can be added to `params` as well. For example:

```nextra-code
authorize_request:
  endpoint: 'https://example.com/oauth2/authorize'
  params:
    response_type: code
    client_id: '{{client_id}}'
    redirect_uri: '{{redirect_uri}}'
    scope: '{{scopes}} {{existing_scopes}}'
    prompt: consent
    access_type: offline
```

#### `token_request` [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#token_request)

This section configures the code/token exchange request, after the user has approved access to your app.

- `endpoint`: The token endpoint for your OAuth 2.0 server, e.g. `/oauth2/token`
- `auth_method` _(optional, default none)_: The authentication method to use. Supported values are none (omitted) and `client_secret_basic`.
- `params`: A map of parameter keys and values to include in the token request.

These placeholders are available in `params`:

- `{{client_id}}`: The configured client ID.
- `{{client_secret}}`: The configured client secret.
- `{{redirect_uri}}`: The redirect URI managed by Arcade.

The `code` parameter is automatically added to the request, and does not need
to be included in `params`. If PKCE is enabled, the `code_verifier` parameter
is also added to the request automatically.

For most providers, `oauth2.token_request.params` will look like:

```nextra-code
token_request:
  endpoint: 'https://example.com/oauth2/token'
  params:
    grant_type: authorization_code
    redirect_uri: '{{redirect_uri}}'
    client_id: '{{client_id}}'
    client_secret: '{{client_secret}}' # Omit if using PKCE
```

- `response_content_type` _(optional, default `application/json`)_: The expected content type of the response. Supported values are `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- `response_map` _(optional)_: A map of keys and values to extract from the response. Supports simple JSONPath expressions. Only applicable if `response_content_type` is `application/json`. See the [JSONPath reference](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2#jsonpath-expressions-in-response_map) for details on extracting values using JSONPath.

#### `refresh_request` [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#refresh_request)

This section configures the refresh token request, if your OAuth 2.0 server supports refresh tokens. If not provided, refresh tokens will not be used.

- `endpoint`: The refresh token endpoint for your OAuth 2.0 server, e.g. `/oauth2/token`
- `auth_method` _(optional, default none)_: The authentication method to use. Supported values are none (omitted), `client_secret_basic`, and `bearer_access_token`.
- `params`: A map of parameter keys and values to include in the refresh token request.

These placeholders are available in `params`:

- `{{refresh_token}}`: The refresh token to use.
- `{{client_id}}`: The configured client ID.
- `{{client_secret}}`: The configured client secret.

For most providers, `oauth2.refresh_request.params` will look like:

```nextra-code
refresh_request:
  endpoint: 'https://example.com/oauth2/token'
  params:
    grant_type: refresh_token
    client_id: '{{client_id}}'
    client_secret: '{{client_secret}}'
```

- `response_content_type` _(optional, default `application/json`)_: The expected content type of the response. Supported values are `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- `response_map` _(optional)_: A map of keys and values to extract from the response. Supports simple JSONPath expressions. Only applicable if `response_content_type` is `application/json`. See the [JSONPath reference](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2#jsonpath-expressions-in-response_map) for details on extracting values using JSONPath.

#### `user_info_request` [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#user_info_request)

Some OAuth 2.0 APIs provide a user info endpoint that returns information about the user. Arcade Engine can automatically request user info from servers that support it. If the `user_info_request` section is omitted, user info will not be requested.

- `endpoint`: The user info endpoint for your OAuth 2.0 server, e.g. `/oauth2/userinfo`
- `auth_method` _(optional, default `bearer_access_token`)_: The authentication method to use. The only supported value is `bearer_access_token`.
- `response_content_type` _(optional, default `application/json`)_: The expected content type of the response. The only supported value is `application/json`.
- `triggers`: Controls when the user info request is made.
  - `on_token_grant`: If `true`, the user info request will be made when a token is granted. This is typically only once for each user, unless new scopes are granted.
  - `on_token_refresh`: If `true`, the user info request will be made every time a token is refreshed.

#### `token_introspection_request` [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#token_introspection_request)

Some OAuth 2.0 APIs provide a token introspection endpoint that can be used to check the validity of a token and retrieve additional information such as token expiration time.

An example of a token introspection request configuration:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: custom-provider
      description: "Custom provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      client_id: ${env:CUSTOM_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:CUSTOM_CLIENT_SECRET}
      oauth2:
        token_introspection_request:
          enabled: true
          endpoint: 'https://example.oauth.com/services/oauth2/introspect'
          method: POST
          params:
            token: '{{access_token}}'
          auth_method: 'client_secret_basic'
          request_content_type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
          response_content_type: application/json
          response_map:
            expires_in: '$.exp'
            scope: '$.scope'
          expiration_format: absolute_unix_timestamp
          triggers:
            on_token_grant: true
            on_token_refresh: true
```

- `enabled` _(optional, default `false`)_: If `true`, the token introspection request will be made.
- `endpoint` _(required)_: The endpoint to use for the token introspection request.
- `method` _(optional, default `GET`)_: The HTTP method to use for the token introspection request.
- `params` _(optional)_: A map of parameter keys and values to include in the token introspection request. Currently, only mapping a field to the internal `access_token` field is supported.
- `auth_method` _(optional, default `client_secret_basic`)_: The authentication method to use for the token introspection request. Supported values are `client_secret_basic` and `bearer_access_token`.
- `request_content_type` _(optional, default `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)_: The content type of the request body.
- `response_content_type` _(optional, default `application/json`)_: The content type of the response body.
- `response_map` _(required)_: A map of keys and values to extract from the response. Supports simple JSONPath expressions. Supported keys are `access_token`, `expires_in`, `refresh_token`, `scope`, and `token_type`.
- `expiration_format` _(optional, default `absolute_unix_timestamp`)_: The format of the expiration time. Supported values are `absolute_unix_timestamp` and `relative_seconds`.
- `triggers` _(required)_: Controls when the token introspection request is made.
  - `on_token_grant`: If `true`, the token introspection request will be made when a token is granted. This is typically only once for each user, unless new scopes are granted.
  - `on_token_refresh`: If `true`, the token introspection request will be made every time a token is refreshed.

#### JSONPath expressions in `response_map` [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#jsonpath-expressions-in-response_map)

In the `token_request` and `refresh_request` sections, you can optionally configure a `response_map`. Configuring a response map is useful if your OAuth 2.0 server returns a JSON object with nested properties, or properties with non-standard names.

The typical JSON payload that most OAuth 2.0 servers return looks like this:

```nextra-code
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "refresh_token": "...",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "scope1 scope2"
}
```

If your server returns a payload that looks like this, you don’t need `response_map`.

But if your server returns:

```nextra-code
{
  "data": {
    "access_token": "...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "...",
    "scope": "scope1 scope2"
  }
}
```

Then you need to configure `response_map` to extract the properties from inside the `data` object. Use [JSONPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONPath) expressions to select the properties you need:

```nextra-code
token_request: # or refresh_request
  response_map:
    access_token: "$.data.access_token"
    expires_in: "$.data.expires_in"
    refresh_token: "$.data.refresh_token" # Only needed if refresh tokens are used
    scope: "$.data.scope" # Only needed if scopes are used
```

Not all OAuth 2.0 servers support refresh tokens, or use scopes. The only required properties are `access_token` and `expires_in`.

#### Handling scope arrays [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#handling-scope-arrays)

Most OAuth 2.0 servers return scopes as a delimited string, such as `scope1 scope2` or `scope1,scope2`. If your server follows this convention, configuring the top-level `scope_delimiter` property in the `oauth2` section is all you need to do.

Some OAuth 2.0 servers return an array of scopes instead of a delimited string. For example:

```nextra-code
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": ["scope1", "scope2"]
}
```

In this case, you need to use the `join()` function in `response_map` to join the scopes into a delimited string:

```nextra-code
token_request:
  response_map:
    access_token: "$.access_token"
    expires_in: "$.expires_in"
    scope: "join('$.scope', ' ')"
```

`join()` takes two arguments:

- `path`: The JSONPath expression to select the array to join.
- `delimiter`: The delimiter to use between array elements. Make sure this matches the `scope_delimiter` setting in the `oauth2` section.

#### Extracting values from JWTs [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#extracting-values-from-jwts)

Some OAuth 2.0 servers return JWT tokens that contain claims you might need to extract. For example, the token might contain scopes or other information about the user. You can use the `jwt_decode()` function in `response_map` to extract values from JWT tokens:

```nextra-code
token_request:
  response_map:
    access_token: "$.access_token"
    expires_in: "$.expires_in"
    scope: "jwt_decode('$.access_token', '$.scope')"
```

`jwt_decode()` takes two arguments:

- `token_path`: The JSONPath expression to select the JWT token.
- `claim_path`: The JSONPath expression to select the claim within the decoded JWT payload.

If the claim is an array (like scopes often are), you can combine `jwt_decode()` with `join()` to extract and format the values:

```nextra-code
token_request:
  response_map:
    access_token: "$.access_token"
    expires_in: "$.expires_in"
    scope: "join(jwt_decode('$.access_token', '$.scp'), ' ')"
```

This is particularly useful when the JWT token contains scopes in an array format (like `scp: ["scope1", "scope2"]`) and you need to convert them to a space-delimited string.

You can also extract nested claims from the JWT payload using dot notation in the claim path:

```nextra-code
token_request:
  response_map:
    access_token: "$.access_token"
    expires_in: "$.expires_in"
    scope: "jwt_decode('$.access_token', '$.nested.scopes')"
```

## Using OAuth 2.0 in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#using-oauth-20-in-app-code)

Use the OAuth 2.0 auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for any OAuth 2.0-compatible APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get an access token:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable


user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="hooli",
    scopes=["scope1", "scope2"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# TODO: Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "hooli", [\
  "scope1",\
  "scope2",\
]);

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// TODO: Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using OAuth 2.0 in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2\#using-oauth-20-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with any OAuth 2.0-compatible APIs.

Use the `OAuth2()` auth class to specify that a tool requires OAuth 2.0 authorization. In your tool function, `context.authorization` will be automatically populated with the following properties:

- `context.authorization.token` contains the user’s access token.
- If `oauth2.user_info_request` is configured, the user info will be fetched and placed in `context.authorization.user_info`. The data payload is specific to each provider.

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import OAuth2


@tool(
    requires_auth=OAuth2(
        provider_id="hooli",
        scopes=["scope1", "scope2"],
    )
)
async def reticulate_splines(
    context: ToolContext,
    num_splines: Annotated[int, "The number of splines to reticulate"],
):
    """Reticulate the specified number of splines."""

    # Get an access token to call an API
    token = context.authorization.token

    # Get user info (if configured and supported by the OAuth 2.0 server):
    user_id = context.authorization.user_info.get("sub")
```

## Tool Authorization Status
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Authorization](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps "Authorization") Checking Authorization Status

# Checking Tool Authorization Status

Before executing tools that require authorization, you can check their authorization status to understand what permissions are needed and whether they’re currently available for a user.

This is useful for:

- Displaying authorization requirements in your UI
- Pre-checking tool availability before execution
- Understanding which tools need user approval
- Debugging authorization issues

### Initialize the client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/tool-auth-status\#initialize-the-client)

Import the Arcade client in a Python/Javascript script.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade() # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable
```

```nextra-code
import Arcade from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable
```

### Check authorization status for all tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/tool-auth-status\#check-authorization-status-for-all-tools)

You can get a list of all available tools and check their authorization status for a specific user:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
USER_ID = "you@example.com"

# Get all tools for the user
tools = client.tools.list(user_id=USER_ID)

for tool in tools:
    print(f"Tool: {tool.name}")

    if tool.requirements:
        # Check if all requirements are met
        print(f"Requirements met: {tool.requirements.met}")

        # Check authorization status
        if tool.requirements.authorization:
            print(f"Authorization status: {tool.requirements.authorization.status}")
            print(f"Token status: {tool.requirements.authorization.token_status}")

        # Check secret requirements
        if tool.requirements.secrets:
            for secret in tool.requirements.secrets:
                print(f"Secret '{secret.key}' met: {secret.met}")
                if not secret.met and secret.status_reason:
                    print(f"Reason: {secret.status_reason}")

    print("---")
```

```nextra-code
const userId = "you@example.com";

// Get all tools for the user
const tools = await client.tools.list({ user_id: userId });

tools.items.forEach(tool => {
    console.log(`Tool: ${tool.name}`);

    if (tool.requirements) {
        // Check if all requirements are met
        console.log(`Requirements met: ${tool.requirements.met}`);

        // Check authorization status
        if (tool.requirements.authorization) {
            console.log(`Authorization status: ${tool.requirements.authorization.status}`);
            console.log(`Token status: ${tool.requirements.authorization.token_status}`);
        }

        // Check secret requirements
        if (tool.requirements.secrets) {
            tool.requirements.secrets.forEach(secret => {
                console.log(`Secret '${secret.key}' met: ${secret.met}`);
                if (!secret.met && secret.status_reason) {
                    console.log(`Reason: ${secret.status_reason}`);
                }
            });
        }
    }

    console.log("---");
});
```

If a username is not provided, the Token Status will be excluded and only the requirements for the provider will be shown.

### Check authorization status for a specific tool [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/tool-auth-status\#check-authorization-status-for-a-specific-tool)

You can also check the authorization status for a specific tool by name:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
USER_ID = "you@example.com"
TOOL_NAME = "Google.ListEmails"

# Get specific tool details
tool = client.tools.get(tool_name=TOOL_NAME, user_id=USER_ID)

print(f"Tool: {tool.name}")
print(f"Description: {tool.description}")

if tool.requirements:
    print(f"All requirements met: {tool.requirements.met}")

    if tool.requirements.authorization:
        auth = tool.requirements.authorization
        print(f"Authorization required: {auth.provider_type}")
        print(f"Authorization status: {auth.status}")
        print(f"Token status: {auth.token_status}")

        if auth.status_reason:
            print(f"Status reason: {auth.status_reason}")

    if tool.requirements.secrets:
        print("Secret requirements:")
        for secret in tool.requirements.secrets:
            status = "✓" if secret.met else "✗"
            print(f"  {status} {secret.key}")
```

```nextra-code
const userId = "you@example.com";
const toolName = "Google.ListEmails";

// Get specific tool details
const tool = await client.tools.get(toolName, {
    user_id: userId
});

console.log(`Tool: ${tool.name}`);
console.log(`Description: ${tool.description}`);

if (tool.requirements) {
    console.log(`All requirements met: ${tool.requirements.met}`);

    if (tool.requirements.authorization) {
        const auth = tool.requirements.authorization;
        console.log(`Authorization required: ${auth.provider_type}`);
        console.log(`Authorization status: ${auth.status}`);
        console.log(`Token status: ${auth.token_status}`);

        if (auth.status_reason) {
            console.log(`Status reason: ${auth.status_reason}`);
        }
    }

    if (tool.requirements.secrets) {
        console.log("Secret requirements:");
        tool.requirements.secrets.forEach(secret => {
            const status = secret.met ? "✓" : "✗";
            console.log(`  ${status} ${secret.key}`);
        });
    }
}
```

## Get Tool Definitions
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Tool Calling](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/tools-overview "Tool Calling") Tool formats

# Get Formatted Tool Definitions

When calling tools directly, it can be useful to get tool definitions in a specific model provider’s format. The Arcade Client provides methods for getting a tool’s definition and also for listing the definitions of multiple tools in a specific model provider’s format.

## Get a single tool definition formatted for a model [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#get-a-single-tool-definition-formatted-for-a-model)

It can be useful to get a tool’s definition in a specific model provider’s format. For example, you may want to get the `Github.SetStarred` tool’s definition in OpenAI’s format.

To do this, you can use the `client.tools.formatted.get` method and specify the tool name and format.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()

# Get a specific tool formatted for OpenAI
github_star_repo = client.tools.formatted.get(name="Github.SetStarred", format="openai")

print(github_star_repo)
```

```nextra-code
import Arcade from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

// Get a specific tool formatted for OpenAI
const githubStarRepo = await client.tools.formatted.get("Github.SetStarred", {
  format: "openai",
});

console.log(githubStarRepo);
```

See output

## Get all tool definitions in a toolkit formatted for a model [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#get-all-tool-definitions-in-a-toolkit-formatted-for-a-model)

It can be useful to list tool definitions for a toolkit in a specific model provider’s format. For example, you may want to get the definitions of tools in the `Github` toolkit in OpenAI’s format.

To do this, you can use the `client.tools.formatted.list` method and specify the toolkit and format. Since this method returns an iterator of pages, you can cast to a list to get all the tools.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()

# Get all tools in the Github toolkit formatted for OpenAI
github_tools = list(client.tools.formatted.list(format="openai", toolkit="github"))

# Print the number of tools in the Github toolkit
print(len(github_tools))
```

```nextra-code
import Arcade from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

// Get all tools in the Github toolkit formatted for OpenAI
const githubTools = await client.tools.formatted.list({
  format: "openai",
  toolkit: "github",
});

// Print the number of tools in the Github toolkit
console.log(githubTools.total_count);
```

## Get all tool definitions formatted for a model [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#get-all-tool-definitions-formatted-for-a-model)

To get all tools formatted for OpenAI, you can use the `client.tools.formatted.list` method without specifying a toolkit.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()

# Get all tools formatted for OpenAI
all_tools = list(client.tools.formatted.list(format="openai"))

# Print the number of tools
print(len(all_tools))
```

```nextra-code

## Get Zod Tool Definitions [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#get-zod-tool-definitions)

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) is a TypeScript-first schema validation library that helps you define and validate data structures. The [Arcade JS](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-js) client offers methods to convert Arcade tool definitions into Zod schemas, providing type safety and validation while enabling seamless integration with AI frameworks like LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, and Mastra AI. Using Zod with Arcade provides:

1. **Type Safety**: Runtime validation of tool inputs and outputs against their defined types
2. **TypeScript Integration**: Provides excellent TypeScript support with automatic type inference
3. **Framework Compatibility**: Direct integration with LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, and Mastra AI

### Convert to Zod Format [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#convert-to-zod-format)

Arcade offers three ways to convert your tools into Zod schemas, each for different use cases:

#### 1\. Convert to array of Zod tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#1-convert-to-array-of-zod-tools)

This method returns an array of tools with Zod validation.

```nextra-code
import { toZod } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib"

const googleToolkit = await arcade.tools.list({
    limit: 20,
    toolkit: "google",
});

const tools = toZod({
    tools: googleToolkit.items,
    client: arcade,
    userId: "<YOUR_USER_ID>",
})
```

#### 2\. Convert to object of Zod tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#2-convert-to-object-of-zod-tools)

This method returns an object with tool names as keys, allowing direct access to tools by name:

```nextra-code
import { toZodToolSet } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib"

const googleToolkit = await arcade.tools.list({
    limit: 20,
    toolkit: "google",
});

const tools = toZodToolSet({
    tools: googleToolkit.items,
    client: arcade,
    userId: "<YOUR_USER_ID>",
})

const emails = await tools.Google_ListEmails.execute({
  limit: 10,
});
```

#### 3\. Convert a single tool [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#3-convert-a-single-tool)

When you only need to work with a specific tool, use this method to convert just that tool to a Zod schema:

```nextra-code
import { createZodTool } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib"

const listEmails = await arcade.tools.get("Google_ListEmails");

const listEmailsTool = createZodTool({
    tool: listEmails,
    client: arcade,
    userId: "<YOUR_USER_ID>",
});

const emails = await listEmailsTool.execute({
  limit: 10,
});
```

### Handle Authorization [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#handle-authorization)

When working with tools that require user authorization (like Gmail, GitHub, Slack, etc.), Arcade provides two approaches to handle the authorization flow when using Zod-converted tools:

#### Option 1: Manual handling [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#option-1-manual-handling)

When you convert Arcade tools to Zod without adding an `executeFactory`, Arcade will try to run tools directly. For tools that need permission (like Google or Slack), you’ll see a `PermissionDeniedError` if the user hasn’t given access yet.

This approach gives you complete control over the authorization flow, making it perfect for custom UI implementations or complex workflows. You’ll have full flexibility to design your own user experience, but you’ll need to handle authorization flows and error states manually in your code.

```nextra-code
import { PermissionDeniedError } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs"

const tools = toZodToolSet({
  tools: googleToolkit.items,
  client: arcade,
  userId: "<YOUR_USER_ID>",
})

try {
	const result = await tools.Google_ListEmails.execute({
		limit: 10,
	});
	console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
	if (error instanceof PermissionDeniedError) {
		// You can use the `arcade.tools.authorize` method to get an authorization URL for the user
		const authorizationResponse = await arcade.tools.authorize({
			tool_name: "Google.ListEmails",
			user_id: "<YOUR_USER_ID>",
		});
		console.log(authorizationResponse.url);
	} else {
		console.error("Error executing tool:", error);
	}
}
```

#### Option 2: Execute and authorize tool [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions\#option-2-execute-and-authorize-tool)

Arcade offers a more convenient way to handle tool execution and initial authorization steps. When converting tools to Zod, you can add the `executeOrAuthorizeZodTool` helper to the `executeFactory`. With this helper, your code no longer needs to catch a `PermissionDeniedError` for tools requiring permissions (as shown in Option 1). Instead, if the user hasn’t yet granted access, the `execute` method will return an `ToolAuthorizationResponse` object that contains the authorization URL.

This approach simplifies your code by:

1. Attempting to execute the tool.
2. If permissions are missing, it returns an object containing the authorization URL. This eliminates the need for both a `try...catch` block for `PermissionDeniedError` and a separate call (like `arcade.tools.authorize`) just to retrieve this URL.
3. If the tool is already authorized, it executes directly. Arcade remembers user authorizations, so once a user approves access, subsequent calls using this helper will execute the tool without prompting for authorization again.

While this helper streamlines obtaining the authorization URL, you are still responsible for presenting this URL to the user. It’s particularly useful for straightforward implementations where you want to reduce boilerplate.

```nextra-code
import { executeOrAuthorizeZodTool } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs"

const tools = toZodToolSet({
	tools: googleToolkit.items,
	client: arcade,
	userId: "<YOUR_USER_ID>",
	executeFactory: executeOrAuthorizeZodTool, // Automatically handles tool authorization flows, including generating auth URLs
});

const result = await tools.Google_ListEmails.execute({
	limit: 10,
});

if ("authorization_required" in result && result.authorization_required) {
	console.log(
		`Please visit ${result.authorization_response.url} to authorize the tool`,
	);
} else {
	console.log(result);
}
```

[Introduction](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/tools-overview "Introduction") [How Arcade Helps](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps "How Arcade Helps")

## Evaluate Tool Effectiveness
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Evaluate toolsWhy evaluate tools?

# Why evaluate tools?

When deploying language models with tool-calling capabilities in production environments, it’s essential to ensure their effectiveness and reliability. This evaluation process goes beyond traditional testing and focuses on two key aspects:

1. **Tool Utilization**: Assessing how efficiently the language model uses the available tools.
2. **Intent Understanding**: Evaluating the language model’s ability to comprehend user intents and select the appropriate tools to fulfill those intents.

Arcade’s Evaluation Framework provides a comprehensive approach to assess and validate the tool-calling capabilities of language models, ensuring they meet the high standards required for real-world applications.

[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJCpZclFzdg?si=mT6y94rkJ5I5mQNp)

## Why Evaluate Tool Calling by Task? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#why-evaluate-tool-calling-by-task)

Language models augmented with tool-use capabilities can perform complex tasks by invoking external tools or APIs. However, without proper evaluation, these models might:

- **Misinterpret user intents**, leading to incorrect tool selection.
- **Provide incorrect arguments** to tools, causing failures or undesired outcomes.
- **Fail to execute the necessary sequence of tool calls**, especially in tasks requiring multiple steps.

Evaluating tool calling by task ensures that the language model can handle specific scenarios reliably, providing confidence in its performance in production settings.

## Evaluation Scoring [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#evaluation-scoring)

Scoring in the evaluation framework is based on comparing the model’s actual tool calls with the expected ones for each evaluation case. The total score for a case depends on:

1. **Tool Selection**: Whether the model selected the correct tools for the task.
2. **Tool Call Arguments**: The correctness of the arguments provided to the tools, evaluated by critics.
3. **Evaluation Rubric**: Each aspect of the evaluation is weighted according to the rubric, affecting its impact on the final score.

The evaluation result includes:

- **Score**: A normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.
- **Result**:
  - _Passed_: Score is above the fail threshold.
  - _Failed_: Score is below the fail threshold.
  - _Warned_: Score is between the warning and fail thresholds.

## Critics: Types and Usage [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#critics-types-and-usage)

Critics are essential for evaluating the correctness of tool call arguments. Different types of critics serve various evaluation needs:

### BinaryCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#binarycritic)

`BinaryCritic` s check for exact matches between expected and actual values after casting.

- **Use Case**: When exact values are required (e.g., specific numeric parameters).
- **Example**: Ensuring the model provides the exact user ID in a function call.

### NumericCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#numericcritic)

`NumericCritic` evaluates numeric values within a specified range, allowing for acceptable deviations.

- **Use Case**: When values can be approximate but should be within a certain threshold.
- **Example**: Accepting approximate results in mathematical computations due to floating-point precision.

### SimilarityCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#similaritycritic)

`SimilarityCritic` measures the similarity between expected and actual string values using metrics like cosine similarity.

- **Use Case**: When the exact wording isn’t critical, but the content should be similar.
- **Example**: Evaluating if the message content in a communication tool is similar to the expected message.

### DatetimeCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#datetimecritic)

`DatetimeCritic` evaluates the closeness of datetime values within a specified tolerance.

- **Use Case**: When datetime values should be within a certain range of the expected time.
- **Example**: Verifying if a scheduled event time is close enough to the intended time.

### Choosing the Right Critic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#choosing-the-right-critic)

- **Exact Matches Needed**: Use **BinaryCritic** for strict equality.
- **Numeric Ranges**: Use **NumericCritic** when a tolerance is acceptable.
- **Textual Similarity**: Use **SimilarityCritic** for comparing messages or descriptions.
- **Datetime Tolerance**: Use **DatetimeCritic** when a tolerance is acceptable for datetime comparisons.

Critics are defined with fields such as `critic_field`, `weight`, and parameters specific to their types (e.g., `similarity_threshold` for `SimilarityCritic`).

## Rubrics and Setting Thresholds [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#rubrics-and-setting-thresholds)

An **EvalRubric** defines the evaluation criteria and thresholds for determining pass/fail outcomes. Key components include:

- **Fail Threshold**: The minimum score required to pass the evaluation.
- **Warn Threshold**: The score threshold for issuing a warning.
- **Weights**: Assigns importance to different aspects of the evaluation (e.g., tool selection, argument correctness).

### Setting Up a Rubric [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#setting-up-a-rubric)

- **Define Fail and Warn Thresholds**: Choose values between 0.0 and 1.0 to represent acceptable performance levels.
- **Assign Weights**: Allocate weights to tool selection and critics to reflect their importance in the overall evaluation.
- **Configure Failure Conditions**: Set flags like `fail_on_tool_selection` to enforce strict criteria.

### Example Rubric Configuration: [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#example-rubric-configuration)

A rubric that requires a score of at least 0.85 to pass and issues a warning if the score is between 0.85 and 0.95:

- Fail Threshold: 0.85
- Warn Threshold: 0.95
- Fail on Tool Selection: True
- Tool Selection Weight: 1.0

```nextra-code
rubric = EvalRubric(
    fail_threshold=0.85,
    warn_threshold=0.95,
    fail_on_tool_selection=True,
    tool_selection_weight=1.0,
)
```

## Building an Evaluation Suite [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#building-an-evaluation-suite)

An **EvalSuite** orchestrates the running of multiple evaluation cases. Here’s how to build one:

1. **Initialize EvalSuite**: Provide a name, system message, tool catalog, and rubric.
2. **Add Evaluation Cases**: Use `add_case` or `extend_case` to include various scenarios.
3. **Specify Expected Tool Calls**: Define the tools and arguments expected for each case.
4. **Assign Critics**: Attach critics relevant to each case to evaluate specific arguments.
5. **Run the Suite**: Execute the suite using the Arcade CLI to collect results.

### Example: Math Tools Evaluation Suite [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#example-math-tools-evaluation-suite)

An evaluation suite for math tools might include cases such as:

- **Adding Two Large Numbers**:
  - **User Message**: “Add 12345 and 987654321”
  - **Expected Tool Call**: `add(a=12345, b=987654321)`
  - **Critics**:
    - `BinaryCritic` for arguments `a` and `b`
- **Calculating Square Roots**:
  - **User Message**: “What is the square root of 3224990521?”
  - **Expected Tool Call**: `sqrt(a=3224990521)`
  - **Critics**:
    - `BinaryCritic` for argument `a`

### Example: Slack Messaging Tools Evaluation Suite [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#example-slack-messaging-tools-evaluation-suite)

An evaluation suite for Slack messaging tools might include cases such as:

- **Sending a Direct Message**:
  - **User Message**: “Send a direct message to johndoe saying ‘Hello, can we meet at 3 PM?’”
  - **Expected Tool Call**: `send_dm_to_user(user_name='johndoe', message='Hello, can we meet at 3 PM?')`
  - **Critics**:
    - `BinaryCritic` for `user_name`
    - `SimilarityCritic` for `message`
- **Posting a Message to a Channel**:
  - **User Message**: “Post ‘The new feature is now live!’ in the #announcements channel”
  - **Expected Tool Call**: `send_message_to_channel(channel_name='announcements', message='The new feature is now live!')`
  - **Critics**:
    - `BinaryCritic` for `channel_name`
    - `SimilarityCritic` for `message`

## Hybrid Worker Deployment
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Hybrid DeploymentHybrid Worker

# Hybrid Worker

A hybrid deployment allows you to execute tools in your own environment while still leveraging Arcade’s cloud Engine infrastructure. This gives you the flexibility to access private resources, maintain data security, and customize your worker environment while leveraging Arcade’s Engine and management capabilities.

## How hybrid workers work [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#how-hybrid-workers-work)

The hybrid worker model uses a bidirectional connection between your local environment and Arcade’s cloud engine:

1. You run the Arcade worker in your environment (on-premises, private cloud, etc.)
2. Your worker is exposed to Arcade’s cloud engine using a public URL
3. The Arcade cloud engine routes tool calls to your worker
4. Your worker processes the requests and returns responses to the engine

## Benefits of hybrid workers [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#benefits-of-hybrid-workers)

- **Resource access**: Access private databases, APIs, or other resources not accessible from Arcade’s cloud
- **Data control**: Keep sensitive data within your environment while still using Arcade’s capabilities
- **Custom environments**: Use specific dependencies or configurations required by your tools
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements by keeping data processing within your infrastructure

## Setting up a hybrid worker [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#setting-up-a-hybrid-worker)

### Setup your toolkits [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#setup-your-toolkits)

Follow the [Creating a Toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) guide to create your toolkits.

Alternatively, you can install an Arcade Toolkit:

```nextra-code
pip install arcade-math
```

### Start your local worker [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#start-your-local-worker)

Run your Arcade worker locally with a secret that you generate in some secure way:

```nextra-code
export ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET=your-secret
arcade serve
```

Verify your worker is running by visiting [http://localhost:8002/worker/health](http://localhost:8002/worker/health).

### Create a public URL [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#create-a-public-url)

To allow the Arcade cloud engine to connect to your locally running worker, you need a public URL. Here are a few options:

ngrokCloudflareTailscale

```nextra-code
ngrok http 8002
```

```nextra-code
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8002
```

```nextra-code
tailscale funnel 8002
```

### Register your worker in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#register-your-worker-in-arcade)

1. Navigate to the [Workers](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/workers) page in your Arcade dashboard
2. Click **Add Worker**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **ID**: Choose a unique identifier (e.g., `my-hybrid-worker`)
   - **Worker Type**: Select `Arcade`
   - **URL**: Enter your public URL from Step 3
   - **Secret**: Enter the secret for your worker (or use `dev` for testing)
   - **Timeout** and **Retry**: Configure as needed for your use case
4. Click **Create**

### Test the connection to your worker [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#test-the-connection-to-your-worker)

You can now test your worker by making requests through the Arcade API or using the Playground:

1. Go to the [Playground](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/playground)
2. Select a tool from your toolkit and execute it
3. Verify that the response is correct and you see request logs in your worker

## Best practices [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#best-practices)

- **Persistent URLs**: For production use, set up a persistent public URL rather than ephemeral ones
- **TLS**: Use a TLS-enabled URL for production use
- **Security**: Use strong secrets for worker authentication
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for your hybrid workers to ensure availability
- **Scaling**: For high-load scenarios, consider running multiple workers behind a load balancer

## Troubleshooting [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#troubleshooting)

- **Connection issues**: Ensure your public URL is accessible and that your local worker is running
- **Authentication failures**: Verify that the worker secret matches what’s configured in the Arcade dashboard
- **Timeout errors**: If your worker takes too long to respond, increase the timeout value in the worker configuration

## Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker\#next-steps)

The Arcade Contacts toolkit provides a pre-built set of tools for interacting with Google Contacts. These tools make it easy to build agents and AI apps that can:

- Create new contacts
- Search for contacts by name or email

## Available Tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/contacts\#available-tools)

These tools are currently available in the Arcade Contacts toolkit.

| Tool Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Google.SearchContactsByEmail | Search the user's contacts in Google Contacts by email address. |
| Google.SearchContactsByName | Search the user's contacts in Google Contacts by name. |
| Google.CreateContact | Create a new contact record in Google Contacts. |

If you need to perform an action that’s not listed here, you can [get in touch\\
with us](mailto:contact@arcade.dev) to request a new tool, or [create your\\
own tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) with the [Google auth\\

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/contacts\#auth)

The Arcade Contacts toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google) to connect to users’ Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there’s nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.

## User Authorization Guide
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [OpenAI Agents](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/overview "OpenAI Agents") Managing user authorization

## User authorization with OpenAI Agents [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/user-auth-interrupts\#user-authorization-with-openai-agents)

In this guide, you will learn how to handle user authorization for Arcade tools in your OpenAI Agents application. When a tool requires authorization, the agent will raise an `AuthorizationError` with a URL for the user to visit and grant permissions.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/user-auth-interrupts\#prerequisites)

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys)

### Install the required packages [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/user-auth-interrupts\#install-the-required-packages)

Set up your environment with the following installations:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
pip install agents-arcade arcadepy
```

```nextra-code
npm install @openai/agents @arcadeai/agents-arcade
```

### Configure your Arcade environment [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/user-auth-interrupts\#configure-your-arcade-environment)

Make sure you have set your Arcade API key in the environment, or assign it directly in the code:

> Need an Arcade API key? Visit the [Get an API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys) page to create one.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
import os
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError

# Set your API key
os.environ["ARCADE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY"

# Initialize the Arcade client
client = AsyncArcade()
```

Add your API key to your environment variables:

```nextra-code
# In your .env file
ARCADE_API_KEY=YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY
```

```nextra-code
import Arcade from '@arcadeai/arcadejs';
import { isAuthorizationRequiredError, toZod } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";
import { Agent, run, tool } from '@openai/agents';

const client = new Arcade();
```

### Fetch Arcade tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/user-auth-interrupts\#fetch-arcade-tools)

Get the tools you need for your agent. In this example, we’ll use GitHub tools:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
# Get GitHub tools for this example
tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["github"])

# Create an agent with GitHub tools
github_agent = Agent(
    name="GitHub agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can assist with GitHub API calls.",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    tools=tools,
)
```

```nextra-code
const githubToolkit = await client.tools.list({ toolkit: "github", limit: 30 });
const arcadeTools = toZod({
  tools: githubToolkit.items,
  client,
  userId: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID_2>", // Replace this with your application's user ID (e.g. email address, UUID, etc.)
})
```

### Handle authorization errors [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/user-auth-interrupts\#handle-authorization-errors)

PythonJavaScript

When a user needs to authorize access to a tool, the agent will raise an `AuthorizationError`. You can handle it like this:

```nextra-code
try:
    result = await Runner.run(
        starting_agent=github_agent,
        input="Star the arcadeai/arcade-ai repo",
        # Pass a unique user_id for authentication
        context={"user_id": "user@example.com"},
    )
    print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
except AuthorizationError as e:
    # Display the authorization URL to the user
    print(f"Please Login to GitHub: {e}")
    # The error contains the authorization URL that the user should visit
```

Choose how to handle authorization errors based on your needs:

**Default behavior (throws errors):**

```nextra-code
const arcadeTools = toZod({
  tools: githubToolkit.items,
  client,
  userId: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID>", // Replace with your user ID
});
```

Use this when you want to handle authorization flow yourself with custom logic.

**Auto-handle authorization (recommended):**

```nextra-code
import { executeOrAuthorizeZodTool } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";

const arcadeTools = toZod({
  tools: githubToolkit.items,
  client,
  userId: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID>", // Replace with your user ID
  executeFactory: executeOrAuthorizeZodTool,
});
```

This automatically returns authorization URLs instead of throwing errors.

**Custom error handling:**

```nextra-code
import { isAuthorizationRequiredError } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";

const tools =  arcadeTools.map((arcadeTool) => {
  return tool({
    ...arcadeTool,
    errorFunction: async (_, error) => {
      if (error instanceof Error && isAuthorizationRequiredError(error)) {
        const response = await client.tools.authorize({
          tool_name: arcadeTool.name,
          user_id: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID>",
        });
        return `Please login to Google: ${response.url}`;
      }
      return "Error executing tool"
    }
  })
});
```

### Wait for authorization completion [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/user-auth-interrupts\#wait-for-authorization-completion)

You can also wait for the user to complete the authorization before continuing:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
import asyncio

client = AsyncArcade()

async def handle_auth_flow(auth_id):
    # Display a message to the user
    print("Please visit the authorization URL in your browser")


    # Wait for the user to authenticate
    await client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_id)

    # Check if authorization was successful
    if await is_authorized(auth_id):
        print("Authorization successful! You can now use the tool.")
        return True
    else:
        print("Authorization failed or timed out.")
        return False

# In your main function
try:
    # Run agent code
    # ...
except AuthorizationError as e:
    auth_id = e.auth_id
    if await handle_auth_flow(auth_id):
        # Try running the agent again
        result = await Runner.run(
            starting_agent=github_agent,
            input="Star the arcadeai/arcade-ai repo",
            context={"user_id": "user@example.com"},
        )
        print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
```

To wait for authorization completion, follow this approach:

1. Throw the error to the agent
2. Catch and handle the error while waiting for completion

```nextra-code
const tools =  arcadeTools.map((arcadeTool) => {
  return tool({
    ...arcadeTool,
    errorFunction: (_, error) => { throw error } // Throw the error to the agent for handling
  })
});

while (true) {
    try {
      const result = await run(googleAgent, "What are my latest emails?");
      console.log(result.finalOutput);
    } catch (error) {
      // Catch the authorization error and wait for completion
      if (error instanceof Error && isAuthorizationRequiredError(error)) {
        const response = await client.tools.authorize({
          tool_name: "Google_ListEmails",
          user_id: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID_2>",
        });
        if (response.status !== "completed") {
          console.log(`Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser: ${response.url}`);
        }

        // Wait for the authorization to complete
        await client.auth.waitForCompletion(response);
        console.log("Authorization completed, retrying...");
      }
    }
  }
```

### Complete example [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/user-auth-interrupts\#complete-example)

Here’s a full example that demonstrates the authorization flow with waiting for authentication:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy.auth import wait_for_authorization_completion

import time

from agents import Agent, Runner
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade

from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError


async def main():
    client = AsyncArcade()
    # Use the "github" toolkit for this example
    tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["github"])

    github_agent = Agent(
        name="GitHub agent",
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can assist with GitHub API calls.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=tools,
    )

    user_id = "user@example.com"  # Make sure to use a unique user ID

    while True:
        try:
            result = await Runner.run(
                starting_agent=github_agent,
                input="Star the arcadeai/arcade-ai repo",
                # Pass the user_id for auth
                context={"user_id": user_id},
            )
            print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
            break  # Exit the loop if successful

        except AuthorizationError as e:
            auth_url = str(e)
            print(f"{auth_url}.  Please authenticate to continue.")

            # Wait for the user to authenticate
            await client.auth.wait_for_completion(e.result.id)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(main())
```

Check out the complete working example in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/tree/main/examples/openai-agents-ts/src/waitForCompletion.ts).

```nextra-code
import Arcade from '@arcadeai/arcadejs';
import { isAuthorizationRequiredError, toZod } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";
import { Agent, run, tool } from '@openai/agents';

async function main() {
  // 1) Initialize Arcade client
  const client = new Arcade();

  // 2) Fetch Google toolkit from Arcade and prepare tools for OpenAI Agents
  const googleToolkit = await client.tools.list({ toolkit: "google", limit: 30 });
  const tools = toZod({
    tools: googleToolkit.items,
    client,
    userId: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID_2>", // Replace this with your application's user ID (e.g. email address, UUID, etc.)
  }).map(tool);

  // 3) Create a new agent with the Google toolkit
  const googleAgent = new Agent({
    name: "Google agent",
    instructions: "You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Google API calls.",
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    tools
  });

  // 4) Run the agent, if authorization is required, wait for it to complete and retry
  while (true) {
    try {
      const result = await run(googleAgent, "What are my latest emails?");
      console.log(result.finalOutput);
      break; // Exit the loop if the result is successful
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof Error && isAuthorizationRequiredError(error)) {
        const response = await client.tools.authorize({
          tool_name: "Google_ListEmails",
          user_id: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID_2>",
        });
        if (response.status !== "completed") {
          console.log(`Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser: ${response.url}`);
        }

        // Wait for the authorization to complete
        await client.auth.waitForCompletion(response);
        console.log("Authorization completed, retrying...");
      }
    }
  }
}

main();
```

This example handles the authentication flow by:

1. Attempting to run the agent
2. Catching any AuthorizationError
3. Open the authentication URL in a browser
4. Waiting for the user to complete authentication
5. Retrying the operation after a wait period

## Authentication persistence [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/user-auth-interrupts\#authentication-persistence)

Once a user authorizes an integration, Arcade will remember the authorization for that specific user\_id and toolkit. You don’t need to re-authorize each time you run the agent.

Key points to remember:

- Always use a consistent and unique `user_id` for each user
- Store the `user_id` securely in your application
- Different toolkits require separate authorization flows
- Authorization tokens are managed by Arcade, not your application

## Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/user-auth-interrupts\#next-steps)

- Build a user interface to handle authorization flows smoothly
- Explore other Arcade toolkits like Google, LinkedIn, or X
- Create multi-step workflows with multiple tools and authorizations
- Learn to build your own custom tools with the Arcade Tool SDK

By handling Arcade’s authorization flow correctly, you can build AI-driven applications that securely integrate with various services while respecting user permissions. Have fun exploring Arcade!

export ARCADE_API_KEY="your_arcade_api_key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

### Get Arcade tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/crewai/use-arcade-tools\#get-arcade-tools)

Use the `ArcadeToolManager` to initialize, add, and get Arcade tools:

```nextra-code
from crewai_arcade import ArcadeToolManager

manager = ArcadeToolManager(default_user_id="user@example.com")

"""
Retrieves the provided tools and/or toolkits as CrewAI StructuredTools.
"""
tools = manager.get_tools(tools=["Google.ListEmails"], toolkits=["Slack"])
```

### Use tools in your CrewAI agent team [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/crewai/use-arcade-tools\#use-tools-in-your-crewai-agent-team)

Create a Crew that uses your tools. When the tool is called, you will be prompted to go visit an authorization page to authorize the tool before it executes.

```nextra-code
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai.llm import LLM

crew_agent = Agent(
    role="Main Agent",
    backstory="You are a helpful assistant",
    goal="Help the user with their requests",
    tools=tools,
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True,
    llm=LLM(model="gpt-4o"),
)

task = Task(
    description="Get the 5 most recent emails from the user's inbox and summarize them and recommend a response for each.",
    expected_output="A bulleted list with a one sentence summary of each email and a recommended response to the email.",
    agent=crew_agent,
    tools=crew_agent.tools,
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[crew_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/microsoft/outlook_calendar\#auth)

The Arcade Outlook Calendar toolkit uses the [Microsoft auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/microsoft) to connect to users’ Microsoft accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there’s nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Microsoft auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/microsoft#configuring-microsoft-auth) with your own Microsoft app credentials.

## Retryable Tool Error
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Build tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit "Build tools") Retry tools with improved prompt

# RetryableToolError in Arcade

Sometimes you may want to retry a tool call with additional context to improve the tool call’s input parameters predicted by the model and try again. You can do this by raising a `RetryableToolError` within the tool.

### Understanding RetryableToolError [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/retry-tools-with-improved-prompt\#understanding-retryabletoolerror)

Raising the `RetryableToolError` is useful when you want to retry the tool call and give the model that is generating the tool call’s input parameters additional context to improve the parameters for the next tool call.

### When to Use RetryableToolError [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/retry-tools-with-improved-prompt\#when-to-use-retryabletoolerror)

A RetryableToolError should be raised from within a tool if additional prompt content would likely improve the tool call outcome.

### Example: Sending a Direct Message in Slack [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/retry-tools-with-improved-prompt\#example-sending-a-direct-message-in-slack)

Below is an example of a tool that sends a direct message to a user in Slack:

1. If the specified user is not found, the tool retrieves a list of all valid inputs for the `user_name` parameter.
2. The tool then raises a `RetryableToolError` with the list of valid inputs.
3. This allows the model to generate a valid input for the `user_name` parameter in the next tool call iteration.

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

from slack_sdk import WebClient

from arcade_tdk.errors import RetryableToolError
from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Slack


@tool(
    requires_auth=Slack(
        scopes=[\
            "chat:write",\
            "im:write",\
            "users.profile:read",\
            "users:read",\
        ],
    )
)
def send_dm_to_user(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_name: Annotated[\
        str,\
        "The Slack username of the person you want to message. Slack usernames are ALWAYS lowercase.",\
    ],
    message: Annotated[str, "The message you want to send"],
) -> Annotated[str, "A confirmation message that the DM was sent"]:
    """Send a direct message to a user in Slack."""

    slackClient = WebClient(token=context.authorization.token)

    # Step 1: Retrieve the user's Slack ID based on their username
    userListResponse = slackClient.users_list()
    user_id = None
    for user in userListResponse["members"]:
        if user["name"].lower() == user_name.lower():
            user_id = user["id"]
            break

    # If the user is not found, raise a RetryableToolError with a
    # list of all valid inputs for the user_name parameter
    if not user_id:
        raise RetryableToolError(
            "User not found",
            developer_message=f"User with username '{user_name}' not found.",
            additional_prompt_content=f"Valid values for user_name input param: {userListResponse}",
            retry_after_ms=500,
        )

    # Step 2: Retrieve the DM channel ID with the user
    im_response = slackClient.conversations_open(users=[user_id])
    dm_channel_id = im_response["channel"]["id"]

    # Step 3: Send the DM
    slackClient.chat_postMessage(channel=dm_channel_id, text=message)

    return "DM sent successfully"
```

## Auth Providers Overview
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Customizing AuthOverview

# Auth Providers

Auth providers enable users to seamlessly and securely allow Arcade tools to access their data.

Arcade has several auth providers available in the Arcade cloud so you don’t have to configure your own. However, using Arcade’s auth providers means that your users will see the Arcade brand (name and logo) on the auth screen and your authentications will share any rate limits from those providers with other Arcade customers.

It can be useful to configure your own auth provider for the following reasons:

- You want to use your own brand on the auth screen
- You want to isolate your rate limits from other Arcade customers
- You want to use a provider that Arcade [does not have a built-in integration for](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2)

After adding an auth provider used by an Arcade tool, executing the tool will automatically use your auth provider. Even in the Arcade Cloud, your auth provider will take precedence over the arcade-provided auth provider.

Adding multiple providers of the same type, not including the arcade-provided ones, can cause Arcade’s tool authorization to fail, see [Using multiple providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Catalog of providers [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers\#catalog-of-providers)

## Using multiple providers of the same type [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers\#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type)

You can create multiple auth providers of the same type, for example, you can have multiple Google auth providers, each with their own client ID and secret. This might be useful if you want separate Google clients to handle calendar and email scopes, for example.

However, Arcade’s tools are configured to select an auth provider by the type. This means that if you have multiple auth providers of the same type, Arcade will not know which one to use and authorizing the tool will fail.

To work around this, you can fork Arcade’s tools and modify them to specify your own auth provider by the unique ID that you give each of them. For example, if you have two Google auth providers, `acme-google-calendar` and `acme-google-email`, you can modify Arcade’s Google.ListEmails tool like this:

```nextra-code
@tool(
    requires_auth=Google(
        id="acme-google-email", # This is the unique ID you gave your auth provider
        scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
    )
)
async def list_emails(
# ...
```

This is similar to the pattern used in the generic OAuth2 provider, but instead of using the `OAuth2` class, you use the `Google` class and specify the `id` of the auth provider you want to use.

See the docs about [Authoring Tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) for more information on how to create and serve a toolkit.

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/calendar\#auth)

The Arcade Calendar toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google) to connect to users’ Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there’s nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.

## Arcade Quickstart Guide
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Quickstart

# Arcade Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with Arcade.dev. First, we will go over Direct Tool Calling, a simple way to call tools directly from your agent.

Direct tool calling is useful in situations where you already know what tool is needed or when there is no prompt for an LLM to interpret and decide on the tool calling. It also gives you full control over what is executed by the Arcade Engine and how.

[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/USoqJOOUP6c?si=ontrjjatjmqMfTHN)

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/quickstart?lang=typescript\#prerequisites)

1. Create an [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=call-tools-directly)
2. Get an [Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys) and take note, you’ll need it in the next steps.

### Install the Arcade client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/quickstart?lang=typescript\#install-the-arcade-client)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
pip install arcadepy
```

```nextra-code
npm install @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

### Instantiate and use the client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/quickstart?lang=typescript\#instantiate-and-use-the-client)

PythonJavaScript

Create a new script called `example.py`:

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

# You can also set the `ARCADE_API_KEY` environment variable instead of passing it as a parameter.
client = Arcade(api_key="arcade_api_key")

# Arcade needs a unique identifier for your application user (this could be an email address, a UUID, etc).
# In this example, simply use your email address as the user ID:
user_id = "user@example.com"

# Let's use the `Math.Sqrt` tool from the Arcade Math toolkit to get the square root of a number.
response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="Math.Sqrt",
    input={"a": '625'},
    user_id=user_id,
)

print(f"The square root of 625 is {response.output.value}")

# Now, let's use a tool that requires authentication to star a GitHub repository
auth_response = client.tools.authorize(
tool_name="GitHub.SetStarred",
user_id=user_id,
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print(f"Click this link to authorize: `{auth_response.url}`.  The process will continue once you have authorized the app." )
    # Wait for the user to authorize the app
    client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response.id);

response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="GitHub.SetStarred",
    input={
        "owner": "ArcadeAI",
        "name": "arcade-ai",
        "starred": True,
    },
    user_id=user_id,
)

print(response.output.value)

```

Create a new script called `example.mjs`:

```nextra-code
import Arcade from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

// You can also set the `ARCADE_API_KEY` environment variable instead of passing it as a parameter.
const client = new Arcade({
  apiKey: "arcade_api_key",
});

// Arcade needs a unique identifier for your application user (this could be an email address, a UUID, etc).
// In this example, simply use your email address as the user ID:
let userId = "you@example.com";

// Let's use the `Math.Sqrt` tool from the Arcade Math toolkit to get the square root of a number.
const response_sqrt = await client.tools.execute({
  tool_name: "Math.Sqrt",
  input: { a: "625" },
  user_id: userId,
});

console.log(response_sqrt.output.value);

// Now, let's use a tool that requires authentication

const authResponse = await client.tools.authorize({
  tool_name: "GitHub.SetStarred",
  user_id: userId,
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log(
    `Click this link to authorize: \`${authResponse.url}\`.  The process will continue once you have authorized the app.`,
  );
  // Wait for the user to authorize the app
  await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse.id);
}

const response_github = await client.tools.execute({
  tool_name: "GitHub.SetStarred",
  input: {
    owner: "ArcadeAI",
    name: "arcade-ai",
    starred: true,
  },
  user_id: userId,
});

console.log(response_github.output.value);
```

### Run the code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/quickstart?lang=typescript\#run-the-code)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
python3 example.py
> The square root of 625 is 25
> Successfully starred the repository ArcadeAI/arcade-ai
```

```nextra-code
node example.mjs
> The square root of 625 is 25
> Successfully starred the repository ArcadeAI/arcade-ai
```

## Next Steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/quickstart?lang=typescript\#next-steps)

In this simple example, we call the tool methods directly. In your real applications and agents, you’ll likely be letting the LLM decide which tools to call - lean more about using Arcade with Frameworks in the [Frameworks](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools) section, or [how to build your own tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).

## Arcade Engine Configuration
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Local Deployment](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install "Local Deployment") ConfigureOverview

# Configuration Overview

Arcade uses configuration files to manage engine settings and default values. When you install the Arcade Engine, two files are created:

- The `engine.yaml` file for engine configuration.
- The `engine.env` file for environment variables.

Let’s explore each file to understand their purpose and how to locate them.

## Engine configuration file [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/overview\#engine-configuration-file)

The `engine.yaml` file controls Arcade Engine settings. It supports variable expansion so you can integrate secrets and environment values seamlessly. You can customize this file to suit your setup. For more details, check the [Engine Configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) page.

Choose your installation method to view the default location of `engine.yaml`:

macOS (Homebrew)Ubuntu/Debian (APT)Manual Download

```nextra-code
$HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY/etc/arcade-engine/engine.yaml
```

```nextra-code
/etc/arcade-ai/engine.yaml
```

```nextra-code
$HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml
```

To manually download the engine.yaml, you can get an example from the [Configuration Templates](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/templates#engineyaml) and add it to `$HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml`.

## Engine environment file [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/overview\#engine-environment-file)

The `engine.env` file contains default environment variables that power Arcade Engine. You can override these defaults by exporting your own variables or by editing the file directly.

Select your installation method below to see the default path for `engine.env`:

macOS (Homebrew)Ubuntu/Debian (APT)Manual Download

```nextra-code
$HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY/etc/arcade-engine/engine.env
```

```nextra-code
/etc/arcade-ai/engine.env
```

```nextra-code
$HOME/.arcade/engine.env
```

To manually download the `engine.env`, refer to the [Configuration Templates](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/templates#engineenv).

## Handle Tool Errors
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Build tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit "Build tools") Handle tool errors

# Tool errors in Arcade

When working with Arcade’s Tool SDK, you may encounter various types of errors. This guide will help you understand and handle these errors effectively.

## Handling errors in your tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/handle-tool-errors\#handling-errors-in-your-tools)

In most cases, you don’t need to raise errors explicitly in your tools. The `@tool` decorator takes care of proper error propagation and handling. When an unexpected error occurs during tool execution, Arcade’s `ToolExecutor` and `@tool` decorator will raise a `ToolExecutionError` with the necessary context and traceback information.

However, if you want to retry the tool call with additional content to improve the tool call’s input parameters, you can raise a [RetryableToolError](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/retry-tools-with-improved-prompt) within the tool.

## Common error scenarios [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/handle-tool-errors\#common-error-scenarios)

Let’s explore some common error scenarios you might encounter:

### 1\. Output type mismatch [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/handle-tool-errors\#1-output-type-mismatch)

This occurs when the expected output type of a tool does not match the actual output type when executed.

```nextra-code
{
  "name": "tool_call_error",
  "message": "tool call failed - Example.Hello failed: Failed to
  serialize tool output"
}
```

For example, the following tool will raise the above error because the tool’s definition specifies that the output should be a string, but the tool returns a list:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated
from arcade_tdk import tool

@tool
def hello(name: Annotated[str, "The name of the friend to greet"]) -> str:
  """
  Says hello to a friend
  """
  return ["hello", name]
```

### 2\. Input parameter type error [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/handle-tool-errors\#2-input-parameter-type-error)

This occurs when the input parameter of a tool is of an unsupported type.

```nextra-code
Type error encountered while adding tool list_org_repositories from
arcade_github.tools.repositories. Reason: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class
```

For example, the following tool will raise the above error because the tool input parameter is of an unsupported type:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated
from arcade_tdk import tool

@tool
def hello(names: Annotated[tuple[str, str, str], "The names of the friends to greet"]) -> str:
  """
  Says hello to a list of friends
  """
  return f"Hello, {names[0]}, {names[1]}, and {names[2]}!"
```

### 3\. Unexpected HTTP error during tool execution [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/handle-tool-errors\#3-unexpected-http-error-during-tool-execution)

This occurs when the tool makes an HTTP request and receives a non-2xx response. Specifically for the example below, the authenticated user did not have permission to access the private organization’s repositories.

```nextra-code
{
  "name": "tool_call_error",
  "message": "tool call failed - Github.ListOrgRepositories failed: Error accessing 'https://api.github.com/orgs/a-private-org/repos': Failed to process request. Status code: 401"
}
```

## Tool Calling Overview
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Tool CallingIntroduction

# What are tools?

Language models excel at text generation but struggle with tasks like calculations, data retrieval, or interacting with external systems. To make an analogy, these models have impressive _brains_ or reasoning capabilities, but lack the _hands_ to interact with the digital world.

To solve this, many AI models support tool calling (sometimes referred to as ‘function calling’).

## The use case for tool-calling [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/tools-overview\#the-use-case-for-tool-calling)

Say a colleague shares a document with you on Google Drive, and you’d like an LLM to help you analyze it.

You could go to your Drive, open the document, copy its contents, and paste it into your chat. But what if the LLM could do this for you? The Arcade Drive toolkit provides a [`SearchAndRetrieveDocuments`](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/drive#searchandretrievedocuments) tool. By calling it, the LLM can find and read the document without you having to do anything.

After analyzing the document, you decide that a meeting is needed with your colleague. You can ask the LLM to schedule a meeting and it will use the [Calendar toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/calendar) to do it without you needing to leave the chat.

Or you could ask the LLM to send a summary of the analysis to your colleague by email and it would use the [Gmail toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/gmail) for that.

## Possibilities for Application and AI Agent developers [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/tools-overview\#possibilities-for-application-and-ai-agent-developers)

Tool-calling combines the reasoning power of LLMs with virtually any action available through APIs or code execution.

With the Arcade SDKs, it is easy to build applications and AI Agents that can leverage tool-calling in order to provide an LLM-powered experience to users in a secure and privacy-forward way.

## How tool calling works [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/tools-overview\#how-tool-calling-works)

AI models that support tool calling can determine when and how to use specific tools to fulfill a user’s request. The developer decides which tools to make available to the model, whether existing tools or tools they’ve built themselves.

In the example above, when the user asks: “ _help me analyze the ‘Project XYZ’ document shared by John on Google Drive_”, the LLM can use its reasoning capabilities to:

1. Recognize that it needs to access external data;
2. Evaluate that the `Drive.SearchAndRetrieveDocuments` tool is the best way to get that data;
3. Call the tool with the appropriate parameters;
4. Read the document content and use it to answer the user’s questions.

## The authorization problem [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/tools-overview\#the-authorization-problem)

One challenge to make all that happen is authorization. How do you give the LLM permission to access someone’s Google Drive and Gmail in a secure and convenient way?

Arcade solves this problem by providing a standardized [interface for authorization](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps), as well as pre-built integrations with [popular services](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers) such as Google, Dropbox, GitHub, Notion, and many more.

Our SDK also [allows you to integrate](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2) LLMs with any OAuth 2.0-compliant API.

## Tool Augmented Generation (TAG) [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/tools-overview\#tool-augmented-generation-tag)

Similar to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), tool calling allows the AI to use external data to answer questions. Unlike RAG, tool calling is more flexible and allows the AI to use tools that are much more diverse than text or vector search alone.

The following is a diagram of how tool calling is used to provide context to a language model similar to RAG.

![Tool calling diagram 1](https://docs.arcade.dev/images/tool-call-diagrams/tool-call-1.png)

First, a language model is given a user’s request. The model then determines if it needs to use a tool to fulfill the request. If so, the model selects the appropriate tool from the tools listed in the request.

The model then predicts the parameters of that tool and passes these parameters back to the client application.

![Tool calling diagram 2](https://docs.arcade.dev/images/tool-call-diagrams/tool-call-2.png)

Now that the tool has been executed, the model can use the output to generate a response.

![Tool calling diagram 3](https://docs.arcade.dev/images/tool-call-diagrams/tool-call-3.png)

This process shows the general outline of the Tool Augmented Generation (TAG) process at a high level.

- **Arcade CLI**: Install the Arcade CLI with `pip install arcade-ai`.

## Deployment Config [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy\#deployment-config)

The `worker.toml` file is used to configure your worker. Running `arcade deploy` will use the `worker.toml` file in the current directory or you can
specify a different file with the `-d` flag.

Running the CLI command `arcade new` will automatically create an example `worker.toml` file for the created toolkit.

```nextra-code
# worker.toml

# Arcade Deploy supports configuring multiple workers in a single file.
# Configurations below each [[worker]] block will be deployed as a separate worker.
[[worker]]

# (Required) The worker configuration
[worker.config]

# (Required) The unique identifier for the worker.
id = "my-example-worker"
# (Optional) Whether the worker is enabled.
enabled = true
# (Optional) The timeout for the worker for requests to the worker.
timeout = 30
# (Optional) The number of times to retry a connection to the worker before giving up.
retries = 3
# (Required) The secret for the worker.
# The default "dev" secret or empty string is not allowed.
# Environment variables can also be used by setting the secret with the format "${env:YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME}"
secret = <your secret>

# (Optional) Localy packages to deploy with the worker.
# You can specify a list of directories that contain a toolkit.
# The directory must contain a pyproject.toml file or a setup.py file.
[worker.local_source]
packages = [ "./my_toolkit1", "./my_toolkit2"]

# (Optional) Pypi packages to install for the worker.
[worker.pypi_source]
packages = [ "arcade-math", "my-pypi-package"]
```

## Secrets [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy\#secrets)

You can use a secret from the environment to configure the worker with the `${env: MY_SECRET}` syntax.

```nextra-code
[[worker]]

[worker.config]
secret = "${env: MY_ENVIRONMENT_SECRET}"
```

## Using with a local engine [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy\#using-with-a-local-engine)

To register the worker with your local engine, you can use the host and port flags.

```nextra-code
arcade deploy -h localhost -p 9099 --no-tls
```

## Logs [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy\#logs)

- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/discord#using-discord-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Discord APIs

## Configuring Discord auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/discord\#configuring-discord-auth)

### Create a Discord app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/discord\#create-a-discord-app)

- Create a Discord Application in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- In the OAuth2 tab, set the redirect URI to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the Client ID and Client Secret (you may need to reset the secret to see it)

Next, add the Discord app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring Discord auth with the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/discord\#configuring-discord-auth-with-the-arcade-dashboard)

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Discord** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-discord-provider”) with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Discord app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Discord auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Discord OAuth provider.

### Configuring Discord auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/discord\#configuring-discord-auth-in-self-hosted-arcade-engine-configuration)

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/discord\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/discord\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `discord` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-discord
      description: "The default Discord provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: discord
      client_id: ${env:DISCORD_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using Discord auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/discord\#using-discord-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Discord auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Discord API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Discord API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="discord",
    scopes=["identify", "email", "guilds", "guilds.join"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "discord", {
  scopes: ["identify", "email", "guilds", "guilds.join"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Discord auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/discord\#using-discord-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Discord API.

Use the `Discord()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Discord. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Discord token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Discord


@tool(
    requires_auth=Discord(
        scopes=["guilds"],
    )
)
async def list_servers(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_id: Annotated[\
        Optional[str],\
        "The user's user ID. Defaults to '@me' for the current user.",\
    ] = "@me",
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of servers the user is a member of"]:
    """List a Discord user's servers they are a member of."""
    url = f"https://discord.com/api/users/{user_id}/guilds"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

## Arcade Hosting Overview
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Overview

# Hosting Options

The best way to use Arcade is to use our cloud service. However, if you need to run Arcade locally to either connect your tools to local-only resources (e.g. a local database or filesystem), or your policies require it, Arcade has you covered!

## Customizing Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hosting-overview\#customizing-auth)

You don’t have to host Arcade to customize your auth experiences. Arcade’s cloud service supports a number of auth providers out of the box, but you can always provide your own OAuth app credentials. We recommend doing this for any production use so that you can have isolated rate limits with the OAuth service provider and give your users a consistent experience when they go through an auth flow.

You can still use the same tools when you customize your auth, no code changes are required.

See [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers) for more information.

## Hybrid Deployments [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hosting-overview\#hybrid-deployments)

Hybrid deployments combine the benefits of running Arcade locally with the benefits of using our cloud service. You can use our cloud service to manage your users and authentication, but run your tools locally.

See [Hybrid Deployment](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-worker) for more information.

## Local Deployments [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/hosting-overview\#local-deployments)

Local deployments involve running all of the Arcade services locally. This is more complex than a hybrid deployment, but it does give you the flexibility to run Arcade anywhere.

See [Local Deployment](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview) for more information.

## Arcade Tools with Vercel AI
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Vercel AIUsing Arcade tools

## Use Arcade with Vercel AI SDK [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/vercelai/use-arcade-tools\#use-arcade-with-vercel-ai-sdk)

The [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) is an open-source library that simplifies the process of building AI-powered applications. It provides a consistent interface for working with various AI providers and includes several useful features:

- Streaming AI responses for real-time interactions
- Framework-agnostic support for React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, and SvelteKit.
- Easy switching between AI providers with a single line of code

Let’s supercharge your Vercel AI SDK applications with Arcade’s tools. You’ll get instant access to production-ready tools for working with Google, Slack, GitHub, LinkedIn, and many other popular services, all with built-in authentication. Browse our [complete toolkit catalog](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits) to discover what you can build.

In this guide, we’ll show you how to use Arcade’s Google toolkit to create an AI agent that can read and summarize emails. You can find the complete code in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/tree/main/examples/ai-sdk) or follow along below.

## Getting started [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/vercelai/use-arcade-tools\#getting-started)

### Install the required dependencies [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/vercelai/use-arcade-tools\#install-the-required-dependencies)

We’ll use the `@ai-sdk/openai` package in this example, but you can use any AI provider supported by the Vercel AI SDK. See the [full list of providers](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/foundations/providers-and-models#ai-sdk-providers).

pnpmnpmyarn

```nextra-code
pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/openai @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

```nextra-code
npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

```nextra-code
yarn install ai @ai-sdk/openai @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

### Get your API keys and set up environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/vercelai/use-arcade-tools\#get-your-api-keys-and-set-up-environment-variables)

You’ll need two API keys:

- **OpenAI API key** from [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Arcade API key** from our [Getting your API key guide](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys)

Add them to your environment:

```nextra-code
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
ARCADE_API_KEY=<YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY>
```

### Import Libraries and Initialize Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/vercelai/use-arcade-tools\#import-libraries-and-initialize-arcade)

```nextra-code
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai"
import { generateText } from "ai"
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs"
import { toZodToolSet, executeOrAuthorizeZodTool } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib"

const arcade = new Arcade()
```

### Get tools from Arcade’s Google toolkit and convert them to Zod [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/vercelai/use-arcade-tools\#get-tools-from-arcades-google-toolkit-and-convert-them-to-zod)

Arcade offers methods to convert tools into Zod schemas, which is essential since the Vercel AI SDK defines tools using Zod. The `toZodToolSet` method is particularly useful, as it simplifies this integration and makes it easier to use Arcade’s tools with the Vercel AI SDK. Learn more about Arcade’s Zod integration options [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions#get-zod-tool-definitions).

```nextra-code
// Get Arcade's google toolkit
const googleToolkit = await arcade.tools.list({ toolkit: "google", limit: 30 })
const googleTools = toZodToolSet({
    tools: googleToolkit.items,
    client: arcade,
    userId: "<YOUR_USER_ID>", // Your app's internal ID for the user (an email, UUID, etc). It's used internally to identify your user in Arcade
    executeFactory: executeOrAuthorizeZodTool, // Checks if tool is authorized and executes it, or returns authorization URL if needed
})
```

### Generate text with the tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/vercelai/use-arcade-tools\#generate-text-with-the-tools)

```nextra-code
const result = await generateText({
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
    prompt: "Read my last email and summarize it in a few sentences",
    tools: googleTools,
    maxSteps: 5,
})

console.log(result.text)
```

On your first run, you’ll get an authorization message with a link to connect your Google account. Open it in your browser to complete the setup. That’s all you need to do! Arcade will remember your approval for future requests.

You can see the full code in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/blob/main/examples/ai-sdk/generateText.js).

## Stream the response [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/vercelai/use-arcade-tools\#stream-the-response)

Vercel AI SDK supports streaming responses. This creates a more engaging, chat-like experience as the responses appear progressively instead of waiting for the complete answer.

To enable streaming, make these key changes:

1. Import `streamText` instead of `generateText`
2. Use `streamText` to create a streamable response
3. Process the response chunk by chunk

```nextra-code
import { streamText } from "ai"

const { textStream } = streamText({
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
    prompt: "Read my last email and summarize it in a few sentences",
    tools: googleTools,
    maxSteps: 5,
})

for await (const chunk of textStream) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk)
}
```

You can see the full code in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/blob/main/examples/ai-sdk/index.js).

## How to use other toolkits [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/vercelai/use-arcade-tools\#how-to-use-other-toolkits)

You just need to change the toolkit parameter in the `list` method. For example, to use Slack tools:

```nextra-code
const slackToolkit = await arcade.tools.list({ toolkit: "slack", limit: 30 })
```

Browse our [complete toolkit catalog](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits) to see all available toolkits and their capabilities. Each toolkit comes with pre-built tools that are ready to use with your AI applications. Arcade also is the best way to create your own custom tools and toolkits - learn more [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).

## Google Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Google

# Google auth provider

The Google auth provider enables tools and agents to call Google/Google Workspace APIs on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Google auth provider seamlessly manage Google OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

Want to quickly get started with Google services in your agent or AI app? The
pre-built [Arcade Google toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/gmail) is what
you want!

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Google auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Google toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/gmail), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Google services
- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google#using-google-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Google APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google#using-google-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Google APIs

## Configuring Google auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#configuring-google-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Google app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Google credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Google app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Google app.

### Create a Google app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#create-a-google-app)

- Follow Google’s guide to [setting up OAuth credentials](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en)
- Choose the [scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) (permissions) you need for your app
- At a minimum, you must enable these scopes:
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile`
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Google app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Google Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#configuring-your-own-google-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Google app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Google Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Google**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-google-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Google app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Google auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Google OAuth provider. If you have multiple Google providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Google auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `google` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-google
      description: "The default Google provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: google
      client_id: ${env:GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using Google auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#using-google-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Google auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for Google APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for Google APIs:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

"""
In this example, we will use Arcade to authenticate with Google and
retrieve Gmail messages.

There is a tool for that in the Arcade SDK, which simplifies the process for
you to retrieve email messages either through our Python or JavaScript
SDKs or via LLM tool calling.

Below we are just showing how to use Arcade as an auth provider, if you ever
need to.
"""

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="google",
    scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token

if not token:
    raise ValueError("No token found in auth response")

credentials = Credentials(token)
gmail = build("gmail", "v1", credentials=credentials)

email_messages = (
    gmail.users().messages().list(userId="me").execute().get("messages", [])
)

print(email_messages)
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "user@example.com";

/*
In this example, we will use Arcade to authenticate with Google and
retrieve Gmail messages.

There is a tool for that in the Arcade SDK, which simplifies the process for
you to retrieve email messages either through our Python or JavaScript
SDKs or via LLM tool calling.

Below we are just showing how to use Arcade as an auth provider, if you ever
need to.
*/

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "google", {
  scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

if (!authResponse.context.token) {
  throw new Error("No token found in auth response");
}

const token = authResponse.context.token;

// Use the Google Gmail API
const response = await fetch(
  "https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages",
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  },
);

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
}

const data = await response.json();
const emailMessages = data.messages || [];

// Return a list of ids and thread ids
console.log(emailMessages);
```

## Using Google auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google\#using-google-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can use the pre-built [Arcade Google toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/gmail) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Google services like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and more.

If the pre-built tools in the Google toolkit don’t meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with Google APIs.

Use the `Google()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Google. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Google token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Google

from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build


@tool(
    requires_auth=Google(
        scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
    )
)
async def list_emails(
    context: ToolContext,
    subject: Annotated[str, "The subject of the email"],
    body: Annotated[str, "The body of the email"],
    recipient: Annotated[str, "The recipient of the email"],
) -> Annotated[str, "A confirmation message with the sent email ID and URL"]:
    """
    Send an email using the Gmail API.
    """
    if not context.authorization or not context.authorization.token:
        raise ValueError("No token found in context")

    credentials = Credentials(context.authorization.token)
    gmail = build("gmail", "v1", credentials=credentials)

    email_messages = (
        gmail.users().messages().list(userId="me").execute().get("messages", [])
    )

    return email_messages
```

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/google_jobs\#auth)

The Arcade Google Jobs toolkit uses the [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) to get job data from Google Jobs.

- **Secret:**
  - `SERP_API_KEY`: Your SerpAPI API key.

Setting the `SERP_API_KEY` secret is only required if you are [self-hosting](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview) Arcade. If you’re using Arcade Cloud, the secret is already set for you. To manage your secrets, go to the [Secrets page](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/secrets) in the Arcade Dashboard.

## Default parameters [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/google_jobs\#default-parameters)

Language is configurable through environment variables. When set, they will be used as default for Google Jobs tools.

Providing a different value as `language` argument in a tool call will override the default value.

**Language**

The language code is a 2-character code that determines the language in which the API will search and return news articles. There are two environment variables:

- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_LANGUAGE`: a default value for all Google search tools. If not set, defaults to ‘en’ (English).
- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_JOBS_LANGUAGE`: a default value for the jobs search tools. If not set, defaults to `ARCADE_GOOGLE_LANGUAGE`.

## Twitch Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Twitch

# Twitch auth provider

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Twitch Auth Provider. To use
Twitch auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Twitch OAuth
2.0 credentials as described below.

The Twitch auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Twitch API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Twitch auth provider seamlessly manage Twitch OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Twitch auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch#using-twitch-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Twitch APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch#using-twitch-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Twitch APIs

## Configuring Twitch auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#configuring-twitch-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Twitch app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Twitch credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Twitch app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Twitch app.

### Create a Twitch app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#create-a-twitch-app)

- Twitch requires that you have two-factor authentication enabled for your account. Enable in your [account security seetings](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security)
- Create a Twitch Application in the [Twitch App Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
- Set the OAuth Redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Select your Application category
- Select the ‘Confidential’ Client Type
- Copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you’ll need below

Next, add the Twitch app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Twitch Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#configuring-your-own-twitch-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Twitch app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Twitch Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Twitch**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-twitch-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Twitch app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Twitch auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Twitch OAuth provider. If you have multiple Twitch providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Twitch auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#set-environment-variables)

The Client ID is the Twitch “App key” and the Client Secret is the Twitch “App
secret”.

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `twitch` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-twitch
      description: "The default Twitch provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: twitch
      client_id: ${env:TWITCH_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using Twitch auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#using-twitch-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Twitch auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Twitch API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Twitch API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="twitch",
    scopes=["channel:manage:polls"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "twitch", {
  scopes: ["channel:manage:polls"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Twitch auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/twitch\#using-twitch-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Twitch API.

Use the `Twitch()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Twitch. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Twitch token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Twitch


@tool(
    requires_auth=Twitch(
        scopes=["channel:manage:polls"],
    )
)
async def create_poll(
    context: ToolContext,
    broadcaster_id: Annotated[\
        str,\
        "The ID of the broadcaster to create the poll for.",\
    ],
    title: Annotated[\
        str,\
        "The title of the poll.",\
    ],
    choices: Annotated[\
        list[str],\
        "The choices of the poll.",\
    ],
    duration: Annotated[\
        int,\
        "The duration of the poll in seconds.",\
    ],
) -> Annotated[dict, "The poll that was created"]:
    """Create a poll for a Twitch channel."""
    url = "https://api.twitch.tv/helix/polls"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
        "Client-Id": "your_client_id",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    payload = {
        "broadcaster_id": broadcaster_id,
        "title": title,
        "choices": [{"title": choice} for choice in choices],
        "duration": duration,
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

# Notion auth provider

The Notion auth provider enables tools and agents to call [Notion APIs](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro) on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Notion auth provider seamlessly manage Notion OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/notion\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Notion auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/notion#using-notion-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the Notion API
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/notion#using-notion-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the Notion API

## Configuring Notion auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/notion\#configuring-notion-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Notion app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Notion credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Notion app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Notion app.

### Create a Notion app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/notion\#create-a-notion-app)

- Create a new public integration in your [integration’s settings page](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Notion auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Notion OAuth provider. If you have multiple Notion providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Notion auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/notion\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export NOTION_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export NOTION_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
NOTION_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"

```

## Using Notion auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/notion\#using-notion-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Notion auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Notion API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Notion API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="notion"
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Notion auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/notion\#using-notion-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can use the pre-built [Arcade Notion toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/development/github/github) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Notion.

If the pre-built tools in the Notion toolkit don’t meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Notion API.

Use the `Notion()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Notion. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Notion token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

import httpx
from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Notion


@tool(requires_auth=Notion())
async def search_page_by_title(
    context: ToolContext,
    title_includes: Annotated[str, "The text to compare against page and database titles."],
) -> Annotated[dict, "The matching pages."]:
    """
    Search for a Notion page by its title.
    """
    url = "https://api.notion.com/v1/search"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": context.authorization.token,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28",
    }
    payload = {"query": title_includes, "filter": {"property": "object", "value": "page"}}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return dict(response.json())

# Discord auth provider

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Discord Auth Provider. To use
Discord auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Discord
OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Discord auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Discord API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Discord auth provider seamlessly manage Discord OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Discord auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord#using-discord-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Discord APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord#using-discord-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Discord APIs

## Configuring Discord auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#configuring-discord-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Discord app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Discord credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Discord app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Discord app.

### Create a Discord app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#create-a-discord-app)

- Create a Discord Application in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- In the OAuth2 tab, set the redirect URI to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the Client ID and Client Secret (you may need to reset the secret to see it)

Next, add the Discord app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Discord Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#configuring-your-own-discord-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Atlassian app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Discord Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Discord**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-discord-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Discord app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Discord auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Discord OAuth provider. If you have multiple Discord providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Discord auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `discord` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-discord
      description: "The default Discord provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: discord
      client_id: ${env:DISCORD_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using Discord auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#using-discord-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Discord auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Discord API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Discord API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="discord",
    scopes=["identify", "email", "guilds", "guilds.join"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "discord", {
  scopes: ["identify", "email", "guilds", "guilds.join"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Discord auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/discord\#using-discord-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Discord API.

Use the `Discord()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Discord. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Discord token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Discord


@tool(
    requires_auth=Discord(
        scopes=["guilds"],
    )
)
async def list_servers(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_id: Annotated[\
        Optional[str],\
        "The user's user ID. Defaults to '@me' for the current user.",\
    ] = "@me",
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of servers the user is a member of"]:
    """List a Discord user's servers they are a member of."""
    url = f"https://discord.com/api/users/{user_id}/guilds"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

## Arcade CLI Tool
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Arcade CLI

# The Arcade CLI

The Arcade CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to manage your Arcade deployments, generate, test, and manage your toolkits, and more.

This same package contains the SDK that you will use to [build your own toolkits](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).

## Installation [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/arcade-cli\#installation)

Like all python packages, the Arcade CLI needs to be installed within the python virtual environment you are using for your Arcade development environment.

Python + uvPython + CondaStandard Python

```nextra-code
# install uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

uv venv --seed
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```nextra-code
# install miniconda: https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install

conda create --name arcade
conda activate arcade
```

```nextra-code
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Now that your python virtual environment is activated, you can install the Arcade CLI with the following command:

uvpip

```nextra-code
uv pip install arcade-ai
```

```nextra-code
pip install arcade-ai
```

## Asana Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Asana

# Asana auth provider

The Asana auth provider enables tools and agents to call Asana APIs on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Asana auth provider seamlessly manage Asana OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

Want to quickly get started with Asana services in your agent or AI app? The
pre-built [Arcade Asana toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/asana) is what you
want!

## What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Asana auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Asana toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/asana), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Asana
- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana#using-asana-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Asana APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana#using-asana-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Asana APIs

## Use Arcade’s Default Asana Auth Provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#use-arcades-default-asana-auth-provider)

Arcade offers a default Asana auth provider that you can use in the Arcade Cloud. In this case, your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

If you choose to use Arcade’s Asana auth, you don’t need to configure anything. Follow the [Asana toolkit examples](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/asana) to get started calling Asana tools.

## Use Your Own Asana App Credentials [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#use-your-own-asana-app-credentials)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Asana app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Asana credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Asana app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create an Asana app.

## Create an Asana App [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#create-an-asana-app)

Follow the documentation on [Building an App with Asana](https://developers.asana.com/docs/overview). You may create a [developer sandbox account](https://developers.asana.com/docs/developer-sandbox) to test your app before moving to production.

When creating your app, use the following settings:

- Set an appropriate App name, description and icon. This will be visible to your users authorizing access to your app.
- Take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
- In the OAuth settings:
  - Under “Redirect URLs”, click **Add Redirect URL** and add `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`.
  - Under “Permission Scopes”, select “Full Permissions”
- In the “App Listing Details” section, optionally add more information about your app.
- In the “Manage Distribution” section, under “Choose a distribution method”, select “Any workspace”.
- Optionally, submit your app for the Asana team review.

Asana [recently\\
introduced](https://forum.asana.com/t/new-oauth-permission-scopes/1048556)
granular permission scopes. This feature is still in preview and the scopes
available at the moment do not include all endpoints/actions that the Asana
Toolkit needs. For those reasons, Arcade uses the “Full Permissions” scope.

## Configuring your own Asana Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#configuring-your-own-asana-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Asana app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (only possible with a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Asana Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Asana**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-asana-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Asana app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Asana auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Asana OAuth provider. If you have multiple Asana providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configure Asana Auth Using the Engine Configuration YAML

Refer to [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information
on how to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

#### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export ASANA_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export ASANA_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
ASANA_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
ASANA_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

#### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

To locate the `engine.yaml` file in your OS after installing the Arcade
Engine, check the [Engine configuration\\
file](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/overview#engine-configuration-file) documentation.

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add an Asana item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: asana
      description: "Custom Asana provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      client_id: ${env:ASANA_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:ASANA_CLIENT_SECRET}

```

#### Restart the Arcade Engine [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#restart-the-arcade-engine)

If the Arcade Engine is already running, you will need to restart it for the changes to take effect.

## Using the Arcade Asana Toolkit [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#using-the-arcade-asana-toolkit)

The [Arcade Asana toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/asana) provides tools to interact with various Asana objects, such as tasks, projects, teams, and users.

Refer to the [toolkit documentation and examples](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/asana) to learn how to use the toolkit to build agents and AI apps that interact with Asana services.

## Using Asana auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#using-asana-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Asana auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Asana API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Asana API:

As explained [above](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana#create-an-asana-app), the Asana granular permission
scopes are in preview and not yet supported. The `"default"` scope should be
used to authorize any action/endpoint you need to call in the Asana API.

PythonJavaScript

If you are [self-hosting Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview), change the `base_url` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(base_url="https://api.arcade.dev")  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="asana",
    scopes=["default"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

# Do something interesting with the token...
auth_token = auth_response.context.token
```

If you are [self-hosting Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview), change the `baseURL` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade({ baseURL: "https://api.arcade.dev" }); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "asana", {
  scopes: ["default"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
const response = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

// Do something interesting with the token...
const auth_token = response.context.token;
```

You can use the auth token to call the [Get multiple tasks endpoint](https://developers.asana.com/reference/gettasks) and read information about tasks, for example. Any Asana API endpoint can be called with the auth token.

## Using Asana auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana\#using-asana-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can use the pre-built [Arcade Asana toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/asana) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Asana.

If the pre-built tools in the Asana toolkit don’t meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with Asana API.

Use the `Asana()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Asana. The authentication token needed to call the Asana API is available in the tool context through the `context.get_auth_token_or_empty()` method.

As explained [above](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana#create-an-asana-app), the Asana granular permission
scopes are in preview and not yet supported. The `"default"` scope should be
used as the only scope in all tools.

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Asana


@tool(requires_auth=Asana(scopes=["default"]))
async def delete_task(
    context: ToolContext,
    task_id: Annotated[str, "The ID of the task to delete."],
) -> Annotated[dict, "Details of the deletion response"]:
    """Deletes a task."""
    url = f"https://api.asana.com/api/1.0/tasks/{task_id}"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.get_auth_token_or_empty()}",
        "Accept": "application/json",
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.delete(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

If you are [self-hosting Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview), you will need to restart the Arcade Worker and the Engine for the new tool to be available.

Your new tool can be called like demonstrated below:

PythonJavaScript

If you are self-hosting, change the `base_url` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(base_url="https://api.arcade.dev")  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

USER_ID = "user@example.com"
TOOL_NAME = "Asana.DeleteTask"

auth_response = client.tools.authorize(tool_name=TOOL_NAME, user_id=USER_ID)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print(f"Click this link to authorize: {auth_response.url}")

# Wait for the authorization to complete
client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

tool_input = {
    "task_id": "1234567890",
}

response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name=TOOL_NAME,
    input=tool_input,
    user_id=USER_ID,
)
print(response.output.value)
```

If you are self-hosting, change the `baseURL` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade({ baseURL: "https://api.arcade.dev" }); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const USER_ID = "user@example.com";
const TOOL_NAME = "Asana.DeleteTask";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.tools.authorize({
  tool_name: TOOL_NAME,
  user_id: USER_ID,
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log(`Click this link to authorize: ${authResponse.url}`);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const toolInput = {
  task_id: "1234567890",
};

const response = await client.tools.execute({
  tool_name: TOOL_NAME,
  input: toolInput,
  user_id: USER_ID,
});

console.log(response.output.value);
```

## Authorized Tool Calling
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Authorization](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps "Authorization") Authorized Tool Calling

# Authorized Tool Calling

Arcade provides an authorization system that handles OAuth 2.0, API keys, and user tokens needed by AI agents to access external services through tools. This means your AI agents can now act on behalf of users securely and privately.

With Arcade, developers can now create agents that can as _as the end user of their application_ to perform tasks like:

- Creating a new Zoom meeting
- Sending or reading email
- Answering questions about files in Google Drive.

Arcade also allows for actions (tools) to be authorized directly. For example, to access a user’s Gmail account, you can utilize the following guide.

### Initialize the client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/auth-tool-calling\#initialize-the-client)

Import the Arcade client in a Python/Javascript script. The client automatically finds API keys set by `arcade login`.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade() # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable
```

```nextra-code
import Arcade from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable
```

### Authorize a tool directly [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/auth-tool-calling\#authorize-a-tool-directly)

Many tools require authorization. For example, the `Google.ListEmails` tool requires authorization with Google.

This authorization must be approved by the user. By approving, the user allows your agent or app to access only the data they’ve approved.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
# As the developer, you must identify the user you're authorizing
# and pass a unique identifier for them (e.g. an email or user ID) to Arcade:
USER_ID = "you@example.com"

# Request access to the user's Gmail account
auth_response = client.tools.authorize(
  tool_name="Google.ListEmails",
  user_id=USER_ID,
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print(f"Click this link to authorize: {auth_response.url}")
```

```nextra-code
// As the developer, you must identify the user you're authorizing
// and pass a unique identifier for them (e.g. an email or user ID) to Arcade:
const userId = "you@example.com";

// Request access to the user's Gmail account
const authResponse = await client.tools.authorize({
  tool_name: "Google.ListEmails",
  user_id: userId,
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log(`Click this link to authorize: ${authResponse.url}`);
}
```

This will print a URL that the user must visit to approve the authorization.

### Check for authorization status [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/auth-tool-calling\#check-for-authorization-status)

You can wait for the authorization to complete using the following methods:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)
```

```nextra-code
await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);
```

### Call the tool with authorization [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/auth-tool-calling\#call-the-tool-with-authorization)

Once the user has approved the action, you can run the tool. You only need to pass the `user_id`:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
emails_response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="Google.ListEmails",
    user_id=USER_ID,
)
print(emails_response)
```

```nextra-code
const emailsResponse = await client.tools.execute({
  tool_name: "Google.ListEmails",
  user_id: userId,
});

console.log(emailsResponse.output.value);
```

Arcade remembers the user’s authorization tokens, so you don’t have to! Next time the user runs the same tool, they won’t have to go through the authorization process again until the auth expires or is revoked.

### How it works [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/auth-tool-calling\#how-it-works)

When you call a tool with `client.tools.execute()`, Arcade:

1. Checks for authorization.
2. Routes the request to the tool’s provider.
3. Returns the tool’s response.

With `client.tools.authorize()`, you can also authorize tools for later use.

These APIs give you programmatic control over tool calling.

### Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/auth-tool-calling\#next-steps)

Arcade also allows you to [build your own tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) to integrate any custom functionality or API to your Agent or AI workflows.

Your tools can use the [service providers supported by Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers) or you can integrate with any [OAuth2-compatible service](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/oauth2).

## Use Arcade with Google ADK [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#use-arcade-with-google-adk)

In this guide, let’s explore how to integrate Arcade tools into your Google ADK application. Follow the step-by-step instructions below.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#prerequisites)

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys)

### Set up your environment [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#set-up-your-environment)

Install the required packages, and ensure your environment variables are set with your Arcade API key:

```nextra-code
pip install google-adk-arcade
```

### Configure API keys [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#configure-api-keys)

Provide your Arcade and Google API keys. You can store it in environment variables or directly in your code:

> Need an Arcade API key? Visit the [Get an API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys) page to create one.

```nextra-code
export ARCADE_API_KEY='YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY'
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY'
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
```

### Create and manage Arcade tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#create-and-manage-arcade-tools)

Use the `get_arcade_tools` function to retrieve tools from specific toolkits:

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
from google_adk_arcade.tools import get_arcade_tools

# Initialize the Arcade client
client = AsyncArcade()

# Get all tools from the "Google" toolkit
tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["google"])

# You can request multiple toolkits at once
tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["google", "github", "linkedin"])

# You can request specific tools
tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, tools=["Google_ListEmails", "Slack_ListUsers", "Slack_SendDmToUser"])
```

### Authorize the tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#authorize-the-tools)

Enable the tools for your agents:

```nextra-code
# authorize the tools
for tool in google_tools:
    result = await client.tools.authorize(
        tool_name=tool.name,
        user_id=user_id
    )
    if result.status != "completed":
        print(f"Click this link to authorize {tool.name}:\n{result.url}")
    await client.auth.wait_for_completion(result)
```

### Set up the agent with Arcade tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#set-up-the-agent-with-arcade-tools)

Create an agent and provide it with the Arcade tools:

```nextra-code
# import the Google ADK requirements
from google.adk import Agent, Runner
from google.adk.artifacts import InMemoryArtifactService
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.genai import types

# create a new session and artifact services
session_service = InMemorySessionService()
artifact_service = InMemoryArtifactService()

# Create an agent with Google tools
google_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    name="google_tool_agent",
    instruction="I can use Google tools to manage an inbox!",
    description="An agent equipped with tools to read Gmail emails."
    tools=tools,
)
```

### Run the agent with user context [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#run-the-agent-with-user-context)

Run the agent, providing a user\_id for tool authorization:

```nextra-code
# create a new session and pass the user id into the context
session = await session_service.create_session(
    app_name=app_name, user_id=user_id, state={
        "user_id": user_id,
    }
)

# create a new runner with the agent and services
runner = Runner(
    app_name=app_name,
    agent=google_agent,
    artifact_service=artifact_service,
    session_service=session_service,
)

# pass a prompt to the agent and stream the response
user_input = "summarize my latest 3 emails"
content = types.Content(
    role='user', parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=user_input)]
)
for event in runner.run(
    user_id=user_id,
    session_id=session.id,
    new_message=content,
):
    if event.content.parts and event.content.parts[0].text:
        print(f'** {event.author}: {event.content.parts[0].text}')
```

### Complete example [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#complete-example)

Here’s a complete example putting everything together:

```nextra-code

            print(f'** {event.author}: {event.content.parts[0].text}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())

```

## Tips for selecting tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#tips-for-selecting-tools)

- **Relevance**: Pick only the tools you need. Avoid using all tools at once.
- **User identification**: Always provide a unique and consistent `user_id` for each user. Use your internal or database user ID, not something entered by the user.

## Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/google-adk/use-arcade-tools\#next-steps)

Now that you have integrated Arcade tools into your Google ADK application, you can:

- Experiment with different toolkits, such as “github” or “linkedin”
- Customize the agent’s instructions for specific tasks
- Try out multi-agent systems using different Arcade tools
- Build your own custom tools with the Arcade Tool SDK

# Arcade for Zoom

## Integrate Arcade with your Zoom account [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/zoom/install\#integrate-arcade-with-your-zoom-account)

Arcade securely connects your AI agents to APIs, data, code, and other systems via Tools. Our Zoom integration allows Arcade’s tools to connect to your Zoom account, helping you manage meetings and gather information more efficiently.

You can leverage this app in Arcade’s Playground when you log in to the Arcade Dashboard, or in your own applications.

While the Arcade app for Zoom does not directly expose a Large Language Model (LLM) to you, you will likely use Arcade’s tools in conjunction with an LLM. When using LLMs, there’s always potential to generate inaccurate responses, summaries, or other output.

Arcade’s Zoom app brings Arcade’s powerful AI tool-calling capabilities to your meeting management. The Arcade app for Zoom can:

- List your upcoming meetings within the next 24 hours
- Retrieve meeting invitation details for specific meetings
- Find the participants and/or registrants for a specific meeting
- and more!

For more details on what tools are available and what scopes they require, see the [Zoom toolkit documentation](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/zoom).

The Arcade Zoom app requires an active Arcade account. If you don’t have one yet, [sign up for free](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=zoom-app-install).

Try leveraging the Arcade Zoom tools in the Arcade Playground by [chatting with an LLM](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/playground/chat) asking, “What meetings do I have scheduled today?” or [executing Zoom tools directly](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/playground/execute?toolId=ListUpcomingMeetings&toolkits=%5B%5D&authProviders=%5B%5D&secrets=%5B%5D&input=%7B%22user_id%22%3A%22me%22%7D) without interacting with an LLM.

When using LLMs with Zoom, responses may sometimes contain inaccuracies. Always review AI-generated content before taking action.

## Support and troubleshooting [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/zoom/install\#support-and-troubleshooting)

If you encounter any issues connecting Arcade to your Zoom account:

1. Verify you’ve granted all required permissions during authorization
2. Ensure your Zoom account is active and in good standing
3. Check that you’re using a compatible browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
4. Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try again

### Adding the Arcade Zoom app to your Zoom account [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/zoom/install\#adding-the-arcade-zoom-app-to-your-zoom-account)

If using the Arcade playground directly did not work, you can try adding the Arcade Zoom app to your Zoom account by clicking the “Connect with Zoom” button below.

[![](https://docs.arcade.dev/images/icons/zoom_fav.svg)Connect with Zoom](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/zoom/install#)

You’ll need to have a Zoom account with appropriate permissions to allow Arcade to access your Zoom data.

### Authorize the requested permissions [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/zoom/install\#authorize-the-requested-permissions)

When connecting Arcade to your Zoom account, depending on which Arcade tools you’ll be using, you’ll be asked to authorize specific permissions:

- **user:read:user** \- Allows Arcade to access basic profile information
- **user:read:email** \- Enables Arcade to access your email address
- **meeting:read:meetings** \- Enables Arcade to list your upcoming meetings
- **meeting:read:invitation** \- Enables Arcade to read meeting invitation details

These permissions ensure Arcade can perform the necessary functions while protecting your privacy and security.

### Removing the Arcade Zoom app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/zoom/install\#removing-the-arcade-zoom-app)

To remove the Arcade Zoom app from your Zoom account, you can do so by going to the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/installed) and uninstalling the app.

Arcade only stores authentication tokens, not your Zoom data. These tokens become invalid when you uninstall the app and will eventually expire. To remove tokens immediately, delete the Zoom Auth Provider from the [Arcade Dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/oauth).

## Privacy and security [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/zoom/install\#privacy-and-security)

Arcade takes the security of your Zoom data seriously:

- We only request the minimum permissions needed for our tools to function
- Your Zoom credentials are never stored on our servers
- All communication between Arcade and Zoom is encrypted
- You can revoke Arcade’s access to your Zoom account at any time through your [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/installed)

## Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/zoom/install\#next-steps)

The Arcade Zoom app is a sample of what Arcade can do with your Zoom account. For your own applications, you might want to [create your own Zoom app](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/zoom). Creating your own Zoom application will allow you to brand the app, customize the permissions, and more.

# Arcade for Slack

## Integrate Arcade with your Slack workspace [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/slack/install\#integrate-arcade-with-your-slack-workspace)

Arcade securely connects your AI agents to APIs, data, code, and other systems via Tools. Our integration for Slack allows Arcade’s tools to connect to your Slack workspace, helping your team work more efficiently.

You can leverage this app in Arcade’s Playground when you log in to the Arcade Dashboard, or in your own applications.

While the Arcade app for Slack does not directly expose a Large Language Model (LLM) to you, you will likely use Arcade’s tools in conjunction with an LLM. When using LLMs, there’s always potential to generate inaccurate responses, summaries, or other output.

Arcade’s sample app for Slack brings Arcade’s powerful AI tool-calling capabilities to your team’s everyday conversations. The Arcade app for Slack can:

- Send messages to your Slack channels and direct messages on your behalf
- Find information in your Slack channels and direct messages
- Generate content, summaries, and responses for messages you receive
- and more!

For more details on what tools are available and what scopes they require, see the [Slack toolkit documentation](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/slack).

The Arcade app for Slack requires an active Arcade account. If you don’t have one yet, [sign up for free](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=slack-app-install).

## How it works [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/slack/install\#how-it-works)

## Authorize LangChain Tools
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [LangChain](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools "LangChain") Authorizing existing tools

## Authorize Existing Tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#authorize-existing-tools)

In this guide, we’ll show you how to authorize LangChain tools like the `GmailToolkit` using Arcade. You may already have tools you want to use, and this guide will show you how to authorize them. Arcade handles retrieving, authorizing, and managing tokens so you don’t have to. For complete working examples, see our [Python](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/blob/main/examples/langchain/langchain_tool_arcade_auth.py) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/blob/main/examples/langchain-ts/langchain-tool-arcade-auth.ts) examples.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#prerequisites)

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys)

### Install the required packages [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#install-the-required-packages)

Instead of the `langchain_arcade` package, you only need the `arcadepy` package to authorize existing tools since Arcade tools are not being used.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
pip install langchain-openai langgraph arcadepy langchain-google-community
```

```nextra-code
npm install @arcadeai/arcadejs @langchain/openai @langchain/core @langchain/langgraph @langchain/community
```

### Import the necessary packages [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#import-the-necessary-packages)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
import os
from arcadepy import Arcade
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from langchain_google_community import GmailToolkit
from langchain_google_community.gmail.utils import build_resource_service
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";
import {
	GmailCreateDraft,
	GmailGetMessage,
	GmailGetThread,
	GmailSearch,
	GmailSendMessage,
} from "@langchain/community/tools/gmail";
import type { StructuredTool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
```

### Initialize the Arcade client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#initialize-the-arcade-client)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
api_key = os.getenv("ARCADE_API_KEY")
client = Arcade(api_key=api_key)
```

```nextra-code
const arcade = new Arcade();
```

### Start the authorization process for Gmail [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#start-the-authorization-process-for-gmail)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
user_id = "user@example.com"
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="google",
    scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
)
```

```nextra-code
const USER_ID = "user@example.com";
const authResponse = await arcade.auth.start(USER_ID, "google", {
	scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
});

```

### Prompt the user to authorize [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#prompt-the-user-to-authorize)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please authorize the application in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)
```

The `auth_response.status` will be `"completed"` if the user has already authorized the application, so they won’t be prompted to authorize again.

```nextra-code
if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
	console.log("Please authorize the application in your browser:");
	console.log(authResponse.url);
}
```

The `authResponse.status` will be `"completed"` if the user has already authorized the application, so they won’t be prompted to authorize again.

### Wait for authorization completion [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#wait-for-authorization-completion)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)
```

The `wait_for_completion` method will do nothing if the user has already authorized the application.

```nextra-code
const completedAuth = await arcade.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);
```

The `waitForCompletion` method will do nothing if the user has already authorized the application.

### Use the token to initialize the Gmail toolkit [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#use-the-token-to-initialize-the-gmail-toolkit)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
creds = Credentials(auth_response.context.token)
api_resource = build_resource_service(credentials=creds)
toolkit = GmailToolkit(api_resource=api_resource)
tools = toolkit.get_tools()
```

```nextra-code
const gmailParam = {
	credentials: {
		accessToken: completedAuth.context.token,
	},
};
const tools: StructuredTool[] = [\
	new GmailCreateDraft(gmailParam),\
	new GmailGetMessage(gmailParam),\
	new GmailGetThread(gmailParam),\
	new GmailSearch(gmailParam),\
	new GmailSendMessage(gmailParam),\
];
```

### Initialize the agent [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#initialize-the-agent)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
agent_executor = create_react_agent(model, tools)
```

```nextra-code
const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" });
const agent_executor = createReactAgent({ llm, tools });
```

### Execute the agent [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/auth-langchain-tools\#execute-the-agent)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
example_query = "Read my latest emails and summarize them."

events = agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [("user", example_query)]},
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```nextra-code
const exampleQuery = "Read my latest emails and summarize them.";
const events = await agent_executor.stream({ messages: [ { role: "user", content: exampleQuery } ] }, {	streamMode: "values" } );
for await (const event of events) {
	console.log(event.messages[event.messages.length - 1]);

## Dropbox Auth Configuration
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Dropbox

# Dropbox auth provider

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Dropbox Auth Provider. To use
Dropbox auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Dropbox
OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Dropbox auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Dropbox API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Dropbox auth provider seamlessly manage Dropbox OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Dropbox auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox#using-dropbox-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Dropbox APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox#using-dropbox-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Dropbox APIs

## Configuring Dropbox auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#configuring-dropbox-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Dropbox app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Dropbox credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Dropbox app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Dropbox app.

### Create a Dropbox app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#create-a-dropbox-app)

- Create a Dropbox Application in the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
- In the Settings tab, under the “OAuth 2” section, set the redirect URI to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the Permissions tab, add any scopes that your app will need
- In the Settings tab, copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you’ll need below

Next, add the Dropbox app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Dropbox Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#configuring-your-own-dropbox-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Dropbox app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Dropbox Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Dropbox**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-dropbox-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Dropbox app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Dropbox auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Dropbox OAuth provider. If you have multiple Dropbox providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Dropbox auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#set-environment-variables)

The Client ID is the Dropbox “App key” and the Client Secret is the Dropbox
“App secret”.

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `dropbox` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-dropbox
      description: "The default Dropbox provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: dropbox
      client_id: ${env:DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET}

```

## Using Dropbox auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#using-dropbox-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Dropbox auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Dropbox API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Dropbox API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="dropbox",
    scopes=["openid", "sharing.read", "files.metadata.read"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "dropbox", {
  scopes: ["openid", "sharing.read", "files.metadata.read"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Dropbox auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/dropbox\#using-dropbox-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Dropbox API.

Use the `Dropbox()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Dropbox. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Dropbox token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Dropbox


@tool(
    requires_auth=Dropbox(
        scopes=["files.metadata.read"],
    )
)
async def list_files(
    context: ToolContext,
    path: Annotated[\
        Optional[str],\
        "The path to the folder to list the contents of. Defaults to empty string to list the root folder.",\
    ] = "",
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of servers the user is a member of"]:
    """Starts returning the contents of a folder."""
    url = "https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/files/list_folder"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json={"path": path})
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/asana\#auth)

The Arcade Asana toolkit uses the [Asana auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana) to connect to users’ Asana accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there’s nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Asana auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/asana#configuring-asana-auth) with your own Asana app credentials.

## Search.GetYoutubeVideoDetails [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/youtube\#searchgetyoutubevideodetails)

See Example >

Get details about a video on YouTube.

**Parameters**

- **video\_id** _(string, required)_ Video ID. E.g. ‘414600577’. This can be retrieved from the search results of the `SearchYoutubeVideos` tool.
- **`language_code`** _(string, optional, Defaults to ‘en’ English)_ 2-character language code to return information about the video. A list of supported language codes can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#languagecodes).
- **`country_code`** _(string, optional, Defaults to ‘us’ United States)_ 2-character country code to return information about the video. A list of supported country codes can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#countrycodes).

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/youtube\#auth)

The Arcade YouTube Search toolkit uses the [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) to get video information from YouTube.

- **Secret:**
  - `SERP_API_KEY`: Your SerpAPI API key.

Setting the `SERP_API_KEY` secret is only required if you are [self-hosting](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview) Arcade. If you’re using Arcade Cloud, the secret is already set for you. To manage your secrets, go to the [Secrets page](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/secrets) in the Arcade Dashboard.

## Default parameter values [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/youtube\#default-parameter-values)

Language and Country are configurable through environment variables. When set, they will be used as default for YouTube tools.

Providing a different value as `language_code` or `country_code` argument in a tool call will override the default value set in the environment variables.

**Language**

The language code is a 2-character code that determines the language in which the API will search and return video information. There are two environment variables:

- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_LANGUAGE`: a default value for all Google Search tools. If not set, defaults to ‘en’ (English).
- `ARCADE_YOUTUBE_SEARCH_LANGUAGE`: a default value for the YouTube Search tools. If not set, defaults to `ARCADE_GOOGLE_LANGUAGE`.

A list of supported language codes can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#languagecodes).

**Country**

The country code is a 2-character code that determines the country in which the API will search for videos:

- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_COUNTRY`: a default value for all Google Search tools. If not set, defaults to `None`.
- `ARCADE_YOUTUBE_SEARCH_COUNTRY`: a default value for the YouTube Search tools. If not set, defaults to `ARCADE_GOOGLE_COUNTRY`. If `ARCADE_GOOGLE_COUNTRY` is not set, the default country for YouTube tools will be `us` (United States).

A list of supported country codes can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#countrycodes).

## Using Arcade Tools
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Mastra](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/overview "Mastra") Using Arcade tools

This guide shows you how to integrate and use Arcade tools within a Mastra agent. For the complete working example, check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/tree/main/examples/mastra).

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/use-arcade-tools\#prerequisites)

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys)
- Basic familiarity with TypeScript and Mastra concepts

### Create a Mastra project [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/use-arcade-tools\#create-a-mastra-project)

Start by creating a new Mastra project using the official CLI:

```nextra-code
# Create a new Mastra project
npx create-mastra@latest my-arcade-agent

# Navigate to the project
cd my-arcade-agent
```

For more details on setting up a Mastra project, refer to the [Mastra documentation](https://mastra.ai/docs/getting-started/installation).

### Install Arcade client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/use-arcade-tools\#install-arcade-client)

Install the Arcade client:

pnpmnpmyarn

```nextra-code
pnpm add @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

```nextra-code
npm install @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

```nextra-code
yarn install @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

### Configure API keys [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/use-arcade-tools\#configure-api-keys)

Set up your environment with the required API keys:

```nextra-code
// Set your API keys in your environment variables or .env file
process.env.ARCADE_API_KEY = "your_arcade_api_key";
process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your_anthropic_api_key"; // or another supported model provider
```

### Convert Arcade tools to Mastra tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/use-arcade-tools\#convert-arcade-tools-to-mastra-tools)

Arcade offers methods to convert tools into Zod schemas, which is essential since Mastra defines tools using Zod. The `toZodToolSet` method is particularly useful, as it simplifies this integration and makes it easier to use Arcade’s tools with Mastra. Learn more about Arcade’s Zod integration options [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions#get-zod-tool-definitions).

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";
import {
	executeOrAuthorizeZodTool,
	toZodToolSet,
} from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";

// Initialize Arcade
const arcade = new Arcade();

// Get Google tools
const googleToolkit = await arcade.tools.list({ toolkit: "google", limit: 30 });
export const googleTools = toZodToolSet({
	tools: googleToolkit.items,
	client: arcade,
	userId: "<YOUR_USER_ID>", // Your app's internal ID for the user (an email, UUID, etc). It's used internally to identify your user in Arcade
	executeFactory: executeOrAuthorizeZodTool, // Checks if tool is authorized and executes it, or returns authorization URL if needed
});

```

### Create and configure your Mastra agent [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/use-arcade-tools\#create-and-configure-your-mastra-agent)

Now create a Mastra agent that uses Arcade tools:

```nextra-code
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";

// Create the Mastra agent with Arcade tools
export const googleAgent = new Agent({
  name: "googleAgent",
  instructions: `You are a Google assistant that helps users manage their Google services (Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, Drive, and Contacts).
  If a tool requires authorization, you will receive an authorization URL.
  When that happens, clearly present this URL to the user and ask them to visit it to grant permissions.`,
  model: anthropic("claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"),
  tools: googleTools,
});
```

### Interact with your agent [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/use-arcade-tools\#interact-with-your-agent)

You can interact with your agent in two main ways:

**1\. Using the Mastra Development Playground:**

Start the Mastra development server:

```nextra-code
npm run dev
```

This will launch a local development playground, typically accessible at `http://localhost:4111`. Open this URL in your browser, select the `googleAgent` from the list of available agents, and start chatting with it directly in the UI.

**2\. Programmatically:**

Alternatively, you can interact with the agent directly in your code:

```nextra-code
// Generate a response from the agent
const response = await googleAgent.generate(
  "Read my last email and summarize it in a few sentences",
);
console.log(response.text);

// Or stream the response for a more interactive experience
const stream = await googleAgent.stream("Send an email to dev@arcade.dev with the subject 'Hello from Mastra'");

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

⚠️

When running your agent for the first time with tools that require user consent (like Google or Github), the agent will return an authorization reponse (e.g., `{ authorization_required: true, url: '...', message: '...' }`). Your agent’s instructions should guide it to present this URL to the user. After the user visits this URL and grants permissions, the tool can be used successfully. See the [Managing user authorization](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/user-auth-interrupts) guide for more details on handling authentication flows.

[Overview](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/overview "Overview") [Managing user authorization](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/user-auth-interrupts "Managing user authorization")

## Reddit Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Reddit

# Reddit auth provider

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Reddit Auth Provider. To use
Reddit auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Reddit OAuth
2.0 credentials as described below.

The Reddit auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Reddit API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Reddit auth provider seamlessly manage Reddit OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Reddit auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit#using-reddit-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Reddit APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit#using-reddit-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Reddit APIs

## Configuring Reddit auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#configuring-reddit-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Reddit app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Reddit credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Reddit app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Reddit app.

### Create a Reddit app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#create-a-reddit-app)

- Create a Reddit Application in the [Reddit App Console](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
- Set the OAuth Redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you’ll need below

Next, add the Reddit app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Reddit Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#configuring-your-own-reddit-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Reddit app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Reddit Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Reddit**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-reddit-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Reddit app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Reddit auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Reddit OAuth provider. If you have multiple Reddit providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Reddit auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#set-environment-variables)

The Client ID is the Reddit “App key” and the Client Secret is the Reddit “App
secret”.

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `reddit` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-reddit
      description: "The default Reddit provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: reddit
      client_id: ${env:REDDIT_CLIENT_ID}

## Using Reddit auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#using-reddit-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Reddit auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Reddit API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Reddit API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="reddit",
    scopes=["identity"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# TODO: Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "reddit", {
  scopes: ["identity"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Reddit auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/reddit\#using-reddit-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Reddit API.

Use the `Reddit()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Reddit. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Reddit token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Reddit


@tool(
    requires_auth=Reddit(
        scopes=["identity"],
    )
)
async def get_user_info(
    context: ToolContext,
) -> Annotated[dict, "The user info"]:
    """Get the user info for the current user."""
    url = "https://oauth.reddit.com/api/v1/me"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
        "User-Agent": "YourAppName v1.0 by u/YourRedditUsername",
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

## Direct API Calls
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Authorization](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps "Authorization") Direct Third-Party API Call

# Direct Third-Party API Call

In this guide, you’ll learn how to use Arcade to obtain user authorization and interact with third-party services by calling their API endpoints directly, without using Arcade for tool execution or definition. We’ll use Google’s Gmail API as an example to demonstrate how to:

- Get authorization tokens through Arcade
- Handle user authentication flows
- Use tokens with external services

This can be useful when you need to manage authorization flows in your application.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#prerequisites)

- Sign up for an [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=call-third-party-apis-directly) if you haven’t already
- Generate an [Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys) and take note of it

### Install required libraries [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#install-required-libraries)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
pip install arcadepy google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

```nextra-code
npm install @arcadeai/arcadejs googleapis
```

### Start coding [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#start-coding)

PythonJavaScript

Create a new file `direct_api_call.py` and import all libraries we’re going to use:

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
```

Create a new file `direct_api_call.js` and import all libraries we’re going to use:

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";
import { google } from "googleapis";
```

### Initialize the Arcade client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#initialize-the-arcade-client)

Create an instance of the Arcade client:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable
```

```nextra-code
const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable
```

### Initiate an authorization request [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#initiate-an-authorization-request)

Use `client.auth.start` to initiate the authorization process:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
# This would be your app's internal ID for the user (an email, UUID, etc.)
user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="google",
    scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
)
```

```nextra-code
// Your app's internal ID for the user (an email, UUID, etc). It's used internally to identify your user in Arcade, not to identify with the Gmail service.
const user_id = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
let auth_response = await client.auth.start(user_id, "google", {
  scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
});
```

### Guide the user through authorization [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#guide-the-user-through-authorization)

If authorization is not completed, prompt the user to visit the authorization URL:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)
```

```nextra-code
if (auth_response.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(auth_response.url);
}
```

### Wait for the user to authorize the request [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#wait-for-the-user-to-authorize-the-request)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)
```

```nextra-code
auth_response = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(auth_response);
```

### Use the obtained token [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#use-the-obtained-token)

Once authorization is complete, you can use the obtained token to access the third-party service:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
credentials = Credentials(auth_response.context.token)
gmail = build("gmail", "v1", credentials=credentials)

email_messages = (
    gmail.users().messages().list(userId="me").execute().get("messages", [])
)

print(email_messages)
```

```nextra-code
// Set up Google API client with the token
const auth = new google.auth.OAuth2();
auth.setCredentials({ access_token: auth_response.context.token });
const gmail = google.gmail({ version: "v1", auth });

// List email messages
const response = await gmail.users.messages.list({
  userId: "me",
});

const email_messages = response.data.messages || [];
console.log(email_messages);
```

### Execute the code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#execute-the-code)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
python3 direct_api_call.py
```

```nextra-code
node direct_api_call.js
```

You should see an output similar to this:, which is a list of the email messages returned by the Gmail API:

```nextra-code
[{'id': '195f77a8ce90f2c1', 'threadId': '195f77a8ce90f2c1'}, {'id': '195ed467a90e8538', 'threadId': '195ed467a90e8538'}, ...]
```

For each item in the list/array, you could use the [`users.messages.get`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/get) endpoint to get the full message details.

Consider using the [Arcade Google toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/gmail), which simplifies the process for retrieving email messages even further! The pattern described here is useful if you need to directly get a token to use with Google in other parts of your codebase.

### How it works [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#how-it-works)

By using `client.auth.start` and `client.auth.wait_for_completion`, you leverage Arcade to manage the OAuth flow for user authorization.

Arcade handles the authorization challenges and tokens, simplifying the process for you.

### Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly\#next-steps)

Integrate this authorization flow into your application, and explore how you can manage different [auth providers](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers) and scopes.

## Custom Auth Flow
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [CrewAI](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/crewai/use-arcade-tools "CrewAI") Custom auth flow

## Custom Auth Flow with CrewAI [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/crewai/custom-auth-flow\#custom-auth-flow-with-crewai)

In this guide, we will explore how to create a custom auth flow that will be performed before executing Arcade tools within your CrewAI agent team.

The `ArcadeToolManager`’s built-in authorization and tool execution flows work well for many typical use cases. However, some scenarios call for a tailored approach. By implementing a custom auth flow, you gain flexibility in handling tool authorization. If your use case calls for a unique interface, additional approval steps, or specialized error handling, then this guide is for you.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/crewai/custom-auth-flow\#prerequisites)

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys)

### Set up your environment [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/crewai/custom-auth-flow\#set-up-your-environment)

Install the required package, and ensure your environment variables are set with your Arcade and OpenAI API keys:

```nextra-code
pip install crewai-arcade
```

### Configure API keys [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/crewai/custom-auth-flow\#configure-api-keys)

Provide your Arcade and OpenAI API keys. You can store them in environment variables like so:

```nextra-code
export ARCADE_API_KEY="your_arcade_api_key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

### Define your custom auth flow [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/crewai/custom-auth-flow\#define-your-custom-auth-flow)

The custom auth flow defined in the following code snippet is a function that will be called whenever CrewAI needs to call a tool.

```nextra-code
from typing import Any

from crewai_arcade import ArcadeToolManager

USER_ID = "user@example.com"

def custom_auth_flow(
    manager: ArcadeToolManager, tool_name: str, **tool_input: dict[str, Any]
) -> Any:
    """Custom auth flow for the ArcadeToolManager

    This function is called when CrewAI needs to call a tool that requires authorization.
    Authorization is handled before executing the tool.
    This function overrides the ArcadeToolManager's default auth flow performed by ArcadeToolManager.authorize_tool
    """
    # Get authorization status
    auth_response = manager.authorize(tool_name, USER_ID)

    # If the user is not authorized for the tool,
    # then we need to handle the authorization before executing the tool
    if not manager.is_authorized(auth_response.id):
        print(f"Authorization required for tool: '{tool_name}' with inputs:")
        for input_name, input_value in tool_input.items():
            print(f"  {input_name}: {input_value}")
        # Handle authorization
        print(f"\nTo authorize, visit: {auth_response.url}")
        # Block until the user has completed the authorization
        auth_response = manager.wait_for_auth(auth_response)

        # Ensure authorization completed successfully
        if not manager.is_authorized(auth_response.id):
            raise ValueError(f"Authorization failed for {tool_name}. URL: {auth_response.url}")
    else:
        print(f"Authorization already granted for tool: '{tool_name}' with inputs:")
        for input_name, input_value in tool_input.items():
            print(f"  {input_name}: {input_value}")


def tool_manager_callback(tool_manager: ArcadeToolManager, tool_name: str, **tool_input: dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
    """Tool executor callback with custom auth flow for the ArcadeToolManager

    ArcadeToolManager's default executor handles authorization and tool execution.
    This function overrides the default executor to handle authorization in a custom way and then executes the tool.
    """
    custom_auth_flow(tool_manager, tool_name, **tool_input)
    return tool_manager.execute_tool(USER_ID, tool_name, **tool_input)
```

### Get Arcade tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/crewai/custom-auth-flow\#get-arcade-tools)

You can now provide the tool manager callback to the `ArcadeToolManager` upon initialization:

```nextra-code
# Provide the tool manager callback to the ArcadeToolManager
manager = ArcadeToolManager(executor=tool_manager_callback)

# Retrieve the provided tools and/or toolkits as CrewAI StructuredTools.
tools = manager.get_tools(tools=["Google.ListEmails"], toolkits=["Slack"])
```

### Use tools in your CrewAI agent team [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/crewai/custom-auth-flow\#use-tools-in-your-crewai-agent-team)

Create a Crew that uses your tools with the custom auth flow. When the tool is called, your tool manager callback will be called to handle the authorization and then the tool will be executed.

```nextra-code
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai.llm import LLM

crew_agent = Agent(
    role="Main Agent",
    backstory="You are a helpful assistant",
    goal="Help the user with their requests",
    tools=tools,
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True,
    llm=LLM(model="gpt-4o"),
)

task = Task(
    description="Get the 5 most recent emails from the user's inbox and summarize them and recommend a response for each.",
    expected_output="A bulleted list with a one sentence summary of each email and a recommended response to the email.",
    agent=crew_agent,
    tools=crew_agent.tools,
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[crew_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,
)

result = crew.kickoff()

print("\n\n\n ------------ Result ------------ \n\n\n")
print(result)
```

## Google.GenerateGoogleFilePickerUrl [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/drive\#googlegenerategooglefilepickerurl)

See Example >

Generate a Google File Picker URL for user-driven file selection and authorization.

This tool generates a URL that directs the end-user to a Google File Picker interface where
where they can select or upload Google Drive files. Users can grant permission to access their
Drive files, providing a secure and authorized way to interact with their files.

This is particularly useful when prior tools (e.g., those accessing or modifying
Google Docs, Google Sheets, etc.) encountered failures due to file non-existence
(Requested entity was not found) or permission errors. Once the user completes the file
picker flow, the prior tool can be retried.

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/google/drive\#auth)

The Arcade Drive toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google) to connect to users’ Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there’s nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.

# Use Arcade in Visual Studio Code

In this guide, you’ll learn how to connect Visual Studio Code to Arcade.dev’s MCP server.

As of version 1.100.0, Visual Studio Code does not yet support [MCP authorization](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization). Only tools that do not require auth, such as math and [search](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/google_search) tools, will work with Visual Studio Code. We’re working to improve this - stay tuned!

### Set up Visual Studio Code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mcp-desktop-clients/vscode-client\#set-up-visual-studio-code)

1. Download and open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (version 1.100.0 or higher)

2. Open the command palette and select **MCP: Add Server…**

3. Choose **HTTP**

4. Paste the following URL: `https://api.arcade.dev/v1/mcps/arcade-anon/mcp`











This URL is Arcade’s public beta MCP server. We’d love to [hear your feedback](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/contact-us)!
Coming soon: deploy a server with your own tools.

5. Give your MCP server a name, like `mcp-arcade-dev`

## Arcade Tools Integration
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") LangChainUsing Arcade tools

## Use LangGraph with Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#use-langgraph-with-arcade)

In this guide, let’s explore how to integrate Arcade tools into your LangGraph application. Follow the step-by-step instructions below. For complete working examples, see our [Python](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/blob/main/examples/langchain/langgraph_arcade_minimal.py) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/blob/main/examples/langchain-ts/langgraph-arcade-minimal.ts) examples.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#prerequisites)

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys)

### Set up your environment [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#set-up-your-environment)

Install the required packages, and ensure your environment variables are set with your Arcade and OpenAI API keys:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
pip install langchain-arcade langchain-openai langgraph
```

```nextra-code
npm install @arcadeai/arcadejs @langchain/openai @langchain/core @langchain/langgraph
```

### Configure API keys [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#configure-api-keys)

Provide your Arcade and OpenAI API keys. You can store them in environment variables or directly in your code:

> Need an Arcade API key? Visit the [Get an API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys) page to create one.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
import os

arcade_api_key = os.environ.get("ARCADE_API_KEY", "YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY")
openai_api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

```nextra-code
ARCADE_API_KEY=<YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
```

### Create and manage Arcade tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#create-and-manage-arcade-tools)

PythonJavaScript

Use the ArcadeToolManager to retrieve specific tools or entire toolkits:

```nextra-code
from langchain_arcade import ArcadeToolManager

manager = ArcadeToolManager(api_key=arcade_api_key)

# Fetch the "ScrapeUrl" tool from the "Web" toolkit
tools = manager.get_tools(tools=["Web.ScrapeUrl"])
print(manager.tools)

# Get all tools from the "Google" toolkit
tools = manager.get_tools(toolkits=["Google"])
print(manager.tools)
```

Arcade offers methods to convert tools into Zod schemas, which is essential since LangGraph defines tools using Zod. The `toZod` method is particularly useful, as it simplifies this integration and makes it easier to use Arcade’s tools with LangGraph. Learn more about Arcade’s Zod integration options [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/get-tool-definitions#get-zod-tool-definitions).

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";
import { executeOrAuthorizeZodTool, toZod } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";

// Initialize the Arcade client
const arcade = new Arcade();

// Get the Arcade tools, you can customize the toolkit (e.g. "github", "notion", "google", etc.)
const googleToolkit = await arcade.tools.list({ toolkit: "google", limit: 30 });
const arcadeTools = toZod({
	tools: googleToolkit.items,
	client: arcade,
	userId: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID>", // Replace this with your application's user ID (e.g. email address, UUID, etc.)
});
// Convert Arcade tools to LangGraph tools
const tools = arcadeTools.map(({ name, description, execute, parameters }) =>
	tool(execute, {
		name,
		description,
		schema: parameters,
	}),
);
console.log(tools);
```

### Set up the language model and memory [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#set-up-the-language-model-and-memory)

Create an AI model and bind your tools. Use MemorySaver for checkpointing:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", api_key=openai_api_key)
bound_model = model.bind_tools(tools)

memory = MemorySaver()
```

```nextra-code
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o", apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
const boundModel = model.bindTools(tools);
const memory = new MemorySaver();
```

### Create a ReAct-style agent [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#create-a-react-style-agent)

Use the prebuilt ReAct agent from LangGraph to handle your Arcade tools:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

graph = create_react_agent(model=bound_model, tools=tools, checkpointer=memory)
```

```nextra-code
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";

const graph = createReactAgent({ llm: boundModel, tools, checkpointer: memory });
```

### Provide configuration and user query [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#provide-configuration-and-user-query)

Supply a basic config dictionary and a user query. Notice that user\_id is required for tool authorization:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "1",
        "user_id": "user@example.coom"
    }
}
user_input = {
    "messages": [\
        ("user", "List any new and important emails in my inbox.")\
    ]
}
```

```nextra-code
const config = {
	configurable: {
		thread_id: "1",
		user_id: "user@example.com",
	},
	streamMode: "values" as const,
};
const user_input = {
	messages: [\
		{\
			role: "user",\
			content: "List any new and important emails in my inbox.",\
		},\
	],
};
```

### Stream the response [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#stream-the-response)

Stream the assistant’s output. If the tool requires authorization, the agent will ask the user to authorize the tool.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from langgraph.errors import NodeInterrupt

try:
    for chunk in graph.stream(user_input, config, stream_mode="values"):
        chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
except NodeInterrupt as exc:
    print(f"\nNodeInterrupt occurred: {exc}")
    print("Please authorize the tool or update the request, then re-run.")
```

```nextra-code
try {
	const stream = await graph.stream(user_input, config);
	for await (const chunk of stream) {
		console.log(chunk.messages[chunk.messages.length - 1]);
	}
} catch (error) {
	console.error("Error streaming response:", error);
}
```

## Tips for selecting tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#tips-for-selecting-tools)

- **Relevance**: Pick only the tools you need. Avoid using all tools at once.
- **Avoid conflicts**: Be mindful of duplicate or overlapping functionality.

## Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools\#next-steps)

Now that you have integrated Arcade tools into your LangGraph agent, you can:

- Experiment with different toolkits, such as “Math” or “Search.”
- Customize the agent’s prompts for specific tasks.
- Try out other language models and compare their performance.

Enjoy exploring Arcade and building powerful AI-enabled Python applications!

## Mastra Overview
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") MastraOverview

## Overview: Arcade Tools in Mastra [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/overview\#overview-arcade-tools-in-mastra)

[Mastra](https://mastra.ai/docs) is an open-source TypeScript agent framework that provides essential primitives for building AI applications. Integrate Arcade’s extensive tool ecosystem to enhance your Mastra agents and enable them to interact seamlessly with numerous third-party services.

This integration enables you to:

- **Access a wide range of tools:** Use Arcade’s [pre-built tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits) for GitHub, Google Workspace, Slack, and more directly within your Mastra agent.
- **Simplify tool management:** Let Arcade handle the complexities of tool discovery, execution, and authentication.
- **Build sophisticated agents:** Combine Mastra’s agent framework (including memory, workflows, and RAG) with Arcade’s powerful tool capabilities.

### How it Works [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/overview\#how-it-works)

The integration works through three key mechanisms:

1. **Tool Discovery:** Access available tools through a unified API ( `arcade.tools.list`).
2. **Schema Conversion:** Transform Arcade’s tool definitions into Mastra-compatible Zod schemas with the `toZodToolSet` utility, enabling seamless integration between the two frameworks without manual schema mapping.
3. **Execution Delegation:** Seamlessly route tool calls from your Mastra agent through Arcade’s API, which handles all the complexities of third-party service authentication and execution.

Before starting, obtain an [Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys).

### Next Steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/overview\#next-steps)

- Learn how to [use Arcade tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/use-arcade-tools) in a Mastra agent
- Implement [user authentication handling](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/mastra/user-auth-interrupts) for tools in multi-user applications

- **Asynchronous support** compatible with OpenAI’s Agent framework

## Basic usage [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/overview\#basic-usage)

Here’s a simple example of using Arcade tools with OpenAI Agents:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from agents import Agent, Runner
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError

async def main():
    # Initialize the Arcade client
    client = AsyncArcade()

    # Get tools from the "google" toolkit
    tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["google"])

    # Create an agent with Google tools
    google_agent = Agent(
        name="Google agent",
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Google API calls.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=tools,
    )

    try:
        # Run the agent with a unique user_id for authorization
        result = await Runner.run(
            starting_agent=google_agent,
            input="What are my latest emails?",
            context={"user_id": "user@example.com"},
        )
        print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
    except AuthorizationError as e:
        print("Please Login to Google:", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Check out the complete working example in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/tree/main/examples/openai-agents-ts/src/index.ts).

```nextra-code
import Arcade from '@arcadeai/arcadejs';
import { executeOrAuthorizeZodTool, toZod } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";
import { Agent, run, tool } from '@openai/agents';

// 1) Initialize Arcade client
const client = new Arcade();

// 2) Fetch Google toolkit from Arcade and prepare tools for OpenAI Agents
const googleToolkit = await client.tools.list({ toolkit: "google", limit: 30 });
const tools = toZod({
  tools: googleToolkit.items,
  client,
  userId: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID>", // Replace this with your application's user ID (e.g. email address, UUID, etc.)
  executeFactory: executeOrAuthorizeZodTool,
}).map(tool);

// 3) Create a new agent with the Google toolkit
const googleAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Google agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Google API calls.",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  tools
});

// 4) Run the agent
const result = await run(googleAgent, "What are my latest emails?");

// 5) Print the result
console.log(result.finalOutput);
```

## Handling authorization [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/overview\#handling-authorization)

PythonJavaScript

When a user needs to authorize access to a tool (like Google or GitHub), the agent will raise an `AuthorizationError` with a URL for the user to visit:

```nextra-code
try:
    # Run agent code
    # ...
except AuthorizationError as e:
    # Display the authorization URL to the user
    print(f"Please visit this URL to authorize: {e}")
```

When a user needs to authorize access to a tool (like Google or GitHub), the agent will show a message like this:

```nextra-code
[Authorize Gmail Access](https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?access_type=offline...)
Once you have authorized access, I can retrieve your latest emails.
```

After visiting the URL and authorizing access, the user can run the agent again with the same `user_id`, and it will work without requiring re-authorization.

## Available toolkits [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/overview\#available-toolkits)

Arcade provides a variety of toolkits you can use with your agents:

- **Google Suite**: Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs
- **Social Media**: LinkedIn, X
- **Development**: GitHub
- **Web**: Web search, content extraction
- **And more**: Weather, financial data, etc.

For a full list of available toolkits, visit the [Arcade Integrations](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits) documentation.

[Integrations](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits "Integrations") [Productivity & Docs](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/asana "Productivity & Docs") Jira

# Jira

**Description:** Enable agents to interact with Jira

**Author:** Arcade

**Code:** [GitHub](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/tree/main/toolkits/jira)

**Auth:** User authorization

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/arcade_jira)](https://pypi.org/project/arcade_jira/)[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/arcadeai/arcade-ai/blob/main/LICENSE)[![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/arcade_jira)](https://pypi.org/project/arcade_jira/)[![Wheel Status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/wheel/arcade_jira)](https://pypi.org/project/arcade_jira/)[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/arcade_jira)](https://pypi.org/project/arcade_jira/)

The Jira toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with Jira, enabling users and AI applications to efficiently manage issues and projects. With this toolkit, you can:

- Create, update, and search for Jira issues using various parameters.
- Retrieve detailed information about issues, projects, users, and issue types.
- Manage issue labels and attachments, including adding and removing them.
- Transition issues between different statuses and manage comments on issues.
- Browse and list available projects, priorities, and users within Jira.

This toolkit streamlines the process of issue management, making it easier to integrate Jira functionalities into applications and workflows.

**The Jira toolkit only supports users authenticated with a single Jira instance.**

When users are prompted to authorize access to their Jira account, they will be asked to select a Jira instance. If a user selects “Instance A” and later also authenticates with “Instance B”, the toolkit will raise an exception.

## Understanding ToolContext
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Build tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit "Build tools") Tool Context

# Understanding ToolContext

## What is ToolContext? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/tool-context\#what-is-toolcontext)

`ToolContext` is a crucial component in Arcade that manages authorization and user information for tools requiring authentication. Let’s explore how it works and how you can use it in your projects.

`ToolContext` is a class that holds two main pieces of information:

1. Authorization context: This includes a token for making authenticated requests to external APIs as well as structured user information for providers that support retrieving user information.
2. User ID: This identifies the user invoking the tool.

Some authorization providers may also include additional structured user information in the `ToolContext`.

## How ToolContext Works [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/tool-context\#how-toolcontext-works)

When you invoke a tool that requires authorization, Arcade’s Tool SDK automatically:

1. Creates a `ToolContext` object
2. Passes this object to your tool

You can then use the `ToolContext` object to make authenticated requests to external APIs.

## Next Steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/tool-context\#next-steps)

Now that you understand the basics of `ToolContext`, you’re ready to apply this knowledge in creating your own authorized tools. To learn how to build a custom tool that requires user authorization, check out our guide on [adding user authorization to your tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-auth) or [adding secrets to your tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-secrets).

[Configuring Arcade Deploy](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy "Configuring Arcade Deploy") [Overview](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Overview")

## Jira Environment Variables
[Integrations](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits "Integrations") [Productivity & Docs](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/asana "Productivity & Docs") [Jira](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/jira "Jira") Environment Variables

# Jira Environment Variables

### `JIRA_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/jira/environment_variables\#jira_max_concurrent_requests)

Arcade uses asynchronous calls to request Jira API endpoints. In some tools, multiple concurrent HTTP requests may be made to speed up execution. This environment variable controls the maximum number of concurrent requests to Jira API in any tool execution.

The value must be a numeric string with an integer greater than or equal to 1.

**Default:** `3`

### `JIRA_API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/jira/environment_variables\#jira_api_request_timeout)

Controls the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response from the Jira API. This is also applied, in some cases, as a global max timeout for multiple requests that are made in a single tool execution. For instance, when a tool needs to paginate results from a given endpoint, this timeout may apply to the entire pagination process in total, not only to the individual requests.

The value must be a numeric string with an integer greater than or equal to 1.

**Default:** `30`

### `JIRA_CACHE_MAX_ITEMS` [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/productivity/jira/environment_variables\#jira_cache_max_items)

The caching strategy does not involve caching Jira API responses that go into tool output, but only internal values.

The Arcade Jira toolkit will cache some values that are repeatedly used in tool execution to enable better performance. This environment variable controls the maximum number of items to hold in each cache.

The value must be a numeric string with an integer greater than or equal to 1.

**Default:** `5000`

## Arcade V2 Migration
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Migrate to V2

# Migration Guide

If your project does not have its dependency on `arcade-ai` pinned to the v1 major version, you must pin it to the v1 major version immediately to prevent potential breakages.

## Release Timeline [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/migrate-to-v2\#release-timeline)

Version 2.0.0 of the Arcade CLI was released on **Tuesday, June 17th**. Make sure to pin your project’s dependency on `arcade-ai` to the v1 major version before this date to avoid any disruptions.

## Package Changes [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/migrate-to-v2\#package-changes)

With the release of version 2.0.0, the [arcade-ai PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/arcade-ai/) has been divided into three distinct packages. Previously, `arcade-ai` was a monolithic package that included:

- Tool Development Kit (TDK)
- Core execution engine and catalog functionality
- FastAPI/MCP server/worker components
- CLI functionality
- Evaluation framework

Now, the `arcade-ai` package serves as Arcade.dev’s CLI, allowing you to create ‘starter’ toolkits, serve and deploy toolkits, chat, and more via the command line. Also, two new packages have been introduced: `arcade-serve` and `arcade-tdk`. This means faster build times, lighter dependencies, and better performance.

## Package Overview [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/migrate-to-v2\#package-overview)

- **arcade-ai**:
  - To get [the CLI](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/arcade-cli), install via: `pip install arcade-ai`
  - To get [the evaluation framework](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/evaluation-framework), install via: `pip install 'arcade-ai[evals]'`
  - To get everything including the TDK and Serve, install via: `pip install 'arcade-ai[all]'`
- **arcade-tdk**:
  - If you’re [writing your own](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) Arcade tools/toolkits.
  - Install via: `pip install arcade-tdk`
- **arcade-serve**:
  - If you’re [writing your own](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/modal-worker) custom worker.
  - Install via: `pip install arcade-serve`

## Code Migration Steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/migrate-to-v2\#code-migration-steps)

Migrating from v1 to v2 is straightforward with a few find-and-replace actions:

1. Replace all occurrences of `arcade.sdk.eval` with `arcade_evals`.
2. Replace all remaining occurrences of `arcade.sdk` with `arcade_tdk`.
3. Replace all occurrences of `arcade.worker` with `arcade_serve`.
4. Remove your project’s required dependency on `arcade-ai`.
5. Add `arcade_tdk>=2.0.0,<3.0.0` as a required dependency if you replaced `arcade.sdk` with `arcade_tdk` in step 2.
6. Add `arcade-ai[evals]>=2.0.0,<3.0.0` as an optional dev dependency if you use the evaluation framework or the CLI.
7. Add `arcade-serve>=2.0.0,<3.0.0` as an optional dev dependency if you use the `arcade serve` CLI command.

## Salesforce Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Salesforce

# Salesforce Auth Provider

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Salesforce Auth Provider and cannot support Salesforce auth in the Arcade Cloud. To use Salesforce auth, the [Salesforce toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/salesforce), or to develop your [custom Salesforce tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit), you must [self-host the Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) and create a custom Auth Provider with your own Salesforce OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Salesforce auth provider enables tools and agents to call Salesforce APIs on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Salesforce auth provider seamlessly manage Salesforce OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

## What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Salesforce auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/salesforce), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Salesforce services
- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce#calling-salesforce-apis-directly) that needs to call Salesforce APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce#create-your-own-salesforce-tools) that need to call Salesforce APIs

## Create a Salesforce app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#create-a-salesforce-app)

Salesforce has two types of apps: **Connected App** and **Lightning App**. For this guide, we’ll create a **Connected App**. Make sure to follow the instructions below while you [create your Connected App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.connected_app_create.htm&type=5).

When creating your app, make sure to:

- Under “API (Enable OAuth Settings)”, check the **Enable OAuth Settings** box
- Set the callback URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the **Available OAuth Scopes**, add the two following scopes:
  - “Manage User Data Via APIs (api)”
  - “Perform requests at any time (refresh\_token, offline\_access)”
- Uncheck the **Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** option, unless you want to use PKCE (in which case, you’ll also need to enable PKCE in the Salesforce auth configuration as [described below](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce#configuring-salesforce-auth))
- Check “Enable Token Exchange Flow”
- Check “Enable Refresh Token Rotation”
- Leave all other settings as default and save your app

Right after creating the app, Salesforce will redirect you to the app’s page. In the “API (Enable OAuth Settings)” section, click on the **Manage Consumer Details** button and take note of the **API Key** and **Client Secret** values.

Then, go back to the App’s page and click on the **Manage** button at the top, then click on the **Edit Policies** button, at the top of the Manage page, and follow the instructions below:

- In “IP Relaxation”, select **Relax IP Restrictions**.
- In “Refresh Token Policy”, make sure the option **Refresh token is valid until revoked** is checked.

With that, your Salesforce app is ready to be used with Arcade.

## Get your Salesforce Org Subdomain [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#get-your-salesforce-org-subdomain)

Follow the steps below to find your Salesforce Org Subdomain:

1. In the Setup menu, click on **Quick Find** in the top left corner and type `"my domain"`.
2. In the search results, under **Company Settings**, click on **My Domain**.
3. Under **My Domain Details**, check the value of the **Current My Domain URL** field.

Your **Salesforce Org Subdomain** is the value before the `.my.salesforce.com` part. For example, if your Salesforce domain is `https://acme-inc.my.salesforce.com`, your Salesforce Org Subdomain is `acme-inc`. If you have a developer account, your URL might look like `https://acme-inc.develop.my.salesforce.com`. In this case, your Salesforce Org Subdomain is `acme-inc.develop`.

Take note of your Salesforce Org Subdomain. You will need this value in the next steps.

## Set the Salesforce Org Subdomain Environment Variable [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#set-the-salesforce-org-subdomain-environment-variable)

Refer to the [previous step](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce#get-your-salesforce-org-subdomain) to find your Salesforce Org Subdomain.

Set the `SALESFORCE_ORG_SUBDOMAIN` environment variable in the same runtime where your Arcade Worker is executed:

```nextra-code
export SALESFORCE_ORG_SUBDOMAIN={your-salesforce-subdomain}
```

## Create and Assign Custom Scopes to your Connected App [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#create-and-assign-custom-scopes-to-your-connected-app)

The Salesforce API requires the App developer to create [OAuth custom scopes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_customscopes.htm&type=5) defining granular permissions for their application users to authorize.

The custom scopes required by the [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/salesforce) are listed below, along with their descriptions:

The custom scopes listed below are only required if you are using the [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/salesforce).

If you’re creating your own [custom Salesforce tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) or using Arcade to authorize users and call Salesforce APIs directly, you are free to define custom scope(s) that fit best your application use cases. Observe that you must have at least one custom scope assigned to your Salesforce app in order to use the Salesforce API.

- `read_account`: Read access to account data.
- `read_contact`: Read access to contact data.
- `read_lead`: Read access to lead data.
- `read_note`: Read access to note data.
- `read_opportunity`: Read access to opportunity data.
- `read_task`: Read access to task data.
- `write_contact`: Write access to create contact.

Follow the [Create an OAuth Custom Scope](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_customscopes_create.htm&type=5) and [Assign an OAuth Custom Scope to a Connected App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_customscopes_assign.htm&type=5) Salesforce documentation to understand how to define and assign these scopes to your Salesforce app.

The scope names aren’t really attached to any endpoint or action. It’s the developer’s job to honor the permissions communicated to the user when authorizing the app. You could, in theory, assign one single scope (e.g. `fullaccess`) and use it to query any Salesforce API endpoint.

## Configuring Salesforce Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#configuring-salesforce-auth)

Refer to [Installing Arcade Locally](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) for more information on how to install and run the Arcade Engine.

You can either configure Salesforce auth from the Arcade Engine Dashboard graphical interface or in the `engine.yaml` file. We describe both options below.

#### Optionally Enable PKCE [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#optionally-enable-pkce)

If you have enabled PKCE when creating your Salesforce app, you must also enable PKCE in the Salesforce auth provider configuration by setting the `pkce` option to `true`.

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: salesforce
      description: "Custom Salesforce provider"
      enabled: true
      pkce: true
      ...
```

#### Restart the Arcade Engine [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#restart-the-arcade-engine)

If the Arcade Engine is already running, you will need to restart it for the changes to take effect.

## Using the Arcade Salesforce Toolkit [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#using-the-arcade-salesforce-toolkit)

The [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/salesforce) provides tools to interact with various Salesforce objects, such as accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, notes, tasks, email messages, call logs, etc.

Refer to the [toolkit documentation and examples](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/sales/salesforce) to learn how to use the toolkit to build agents and AI apps that interact with Salesforce services.

Check our introductory documentation to understand what are tools and how [tool calling works](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/use-tools/tools-overview).

## Calling Salesforce APIs directly [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#calling-salesforce-apis-directly)

Use the Salesforce auth provider to get a user authorization token and call Salesforce API endpoints directly, without the use of any tools. See [How Arcade helps with Agent Authorization](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#prerequisites)

1. Create an [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=salesforce-auth-provider)
2. Get an [Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys).
3. Set the `ARCADE_API_KEY` environment variable with `export ARCADE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>`.
4. Make sure to have Python 3.10+ or Node.js 18+ installed.

PythonJavaScript

### Install the Arcade Python Client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#install-the-arcade-python-client)

```nextra-code
pip install arcadepy
```

### Import necessary modules and instantiate the client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#import-necessary-modules-and-instantiate-the-client)

Create a new script called `salesforce_example.py`. Import the necessary modules and instantiate the Arcade client:

The Arcade Engine service is available at `http://localhost:9099` by default. Replace the host and port, if necessary, to match your environment.

```nextra-code
import requests
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(base_url="http://localhost:9099")  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable
```

### Set the values required for the Salesforce API call [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#set-the-values-required-for-the-salesforce-api-call)

```nextra-code
salesforce_provider_id = "salesforce"
salesforce_org_subdomain = "salesforce-org-subdomain"
user_id = "user@example.com"
scopes = ["read_account"]
```

Here’s a break down of each value:

- **`salesforce_provider_id`**: the ID you entered when setting up the [Salesforce auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce#configuring-salesforce-auth);
- **`salesforce_org_subdomain`**: your [Salesforce Org Subdomain](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce#get-your-salesforce-org-subdomain);
- **`user_id`**: an internal identifier for your application user (it could be an email address, a username, UUID, etc); for demonstration purposes, in this example, enter your own email address;
- **`scopes`**: the list of scopes you want to request from the user; if you assigned the [custom scopes required by the Arcade Salesforce toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce#create-and-assign-custom-scopes-to-your-connected-app) use `["read_account"]` in this example.

### Start the authorization process and wait for completion [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#start-the-authorization-process-and-wait-for-completion)

The Arcade client will prompt the user to access a URL and authorize the app to access their Salesforce data. At the end of the auth process, you will have a token that can be used to call Salesforce APIs on behalf of that user.

```nextra-code
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider=salesforce_provider_id,
    scopes=scopes,
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token

if not token:
    raise ValueError("No token found in auth response")
```

If the same scopes have already been authorized by the user before and the token is still valid, the auth process will be skipped and the token will be returned immediately, without prompting with the authorization URL. The Arcade Engine associates a previously authorized token with the `user_id` you provided.

### Call the Salesforce API [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#call-the-salesforce-api)

We will now call the Salesforce `/parameterizedSearch` API endpoint to search and retrieve account data.

Replace the `q` value of `"acme"` with any keyword combination of your choice. In a real-world scenario, this value would most likely come from a user’s input. Observe that the `q` argument must be a string with two or more characters.

```nextra-code
response = requests.post(
    f"https://{salesforce_org_subdomain}.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v63.0/parameterizedSearch",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
    json={
        "q": "acme",
        "sobjects": [\
            {"name": "Account", "fields": ["Id", "Name", "Website", "Phone"]},\
        ],
        "in": "ALL",
        "overallLimit": 10,
        "offset": 0,
    },
)

if not response.ok:
    raise ValueError(
        f"Failed to retrieve Salesforce data: {response.status_code} - {response.text}"
    )
```

### Install the Arcade JavaScript Client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#install-the-arcade-javascript-client)

```nextra-code
npm install @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

### Import necessary modules and instantiate the client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#import-necessary-modules-and-instantiate-the-client-1)

Create a new script called `salesforce_example.js`. Import the necessary modules and instantiate the Arcade client:

Replace `http://localhost:9099` with the URL of your Arcade Engine.

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade((baseURL = "http://localhost:9099")); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable
```

### Set the values required for the Salesforce API call [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#set-the-values-required-for-the-salesforce-api-call-1)

```nextra-code
const salesforceProviderId = "salesforce";
const salesforceOrgSubdomain = "salesforce-org-subdomain";
const userId = "user@example.com";
const scopes = ["read_account"];
```

Here’s a break down of each value:

- **`salesforceProviderId`**: the ID you entered when setting up the [Salesforce auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce#configuring-salesforce-auth);
- **`salesforceOrgSubdomain`**: your [Salesforce Org Subdomain](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce#get-your-salesforce-org-subdomain);
- **`userId`**: an internal identifier for your application user (it could be an email address, a username, UUID, etc); for demonstration purposes, in this example, enter your own email address;
- **`scopes`**: the list of scopes you want to request from the user; if you assigned the [custom scopes required by the Arcade Salesforce toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce#create-and-assign-custom-scopes-to-your-connected-app) use `["read_account"]` in this example.

### Start the authorization process and wait for completion [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#start-the-authorization-process-and-wait-for-completion-1)

The Arcade client will prompt the user to access a URL and authorize the app to access their Salesforce data. At the end of the auth process, you will have a token that can be used to call Salesforce APIs on behalf of that user.

```nextra-code
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, {
  provider: salesforceProviderId,
  scopes: scopes,
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

if (!authResponse.context.token) {
  throw new Error("No token found in auth response");
}

const token = authResponse.context.token;

if (!token) {
  throw new Error("No token found in auth response");
```

If the same scopes have already been authorized by the user before and the token is still valid, the auth process will be skipped and the token will be returned immediately, without prompting with the authorization URL. The Arcade Engine associates a previously authorized token with the `user_id` you provide.

### Call the Salesforce API [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/salesforce\#call-the-salesforce-api-1)

We will now call the Salesforce `/parameterizedSearch` API endpoint to search and retrieve account data.

Replace the `q` value of `"acme"` with any keyword combination of your choice. In a real-world scenario, this value would most likely come from a user’s input. Observe that the `q` argument must be a string with two or more characters.

```nextra-code
// Use the Salesforce API
const response = await fetch(
  `https://${salesforceOrgSubdomain}.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v63.0/parameterizedSearch`,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      q: "acme",
      sobjects: [\
        { name: "Account", fields: ["Id", "Name", "Website", "Phone"] },\
      ],
      in: "ALL",
      overallLimit: 10,
      offset: 0,
    }),

## Run Evaluations
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Evaluate tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools "Evaluate tools") Run evaluations

# Run evaluations with the Arcade CLI

The Arcade Evaluation Framework allows you to run evaluations of your tool-enabled language models conveniently using the command-line interface (CLI). This enables you to execute your evaluation suites, gather results, and analyze the performance of your models in an efficient and streamlined manner.

### Using the `arcade evals` Command [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#using-the-arcade-evals-command)

To run evaluations, use the `arcade evals` command provided by the Arcade CLI. This command searches for evaluation files in the specified directory, executes any functions decorated with `@tool_eval`, and displays the results.

#### Basic Usage [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#basic-usage)

```nextra-code
arcade evals <directory>
```

- `<directory>`: The directory containing your evaluation files. By default, it searches the current directory ( `.`).

For example, to run evaluations in the current directory:

```nextra-code
arcade evals .
```

The Arcade Evaluation Framework also supports running a single evaluation file:

```nextra-code
arcade evals <eval_your_file.py>
```

#### Evaluation File Naming Convention [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#evaluation-file-naming-convention)

The `arcade evals` command looks for Python files that start with `eval_` and end with `.py` (e.g., `eval_math_tools.py`, `eval_slack_messaging.py`). These files should contain your evaluation suites.

#### Command Options [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#command-options)

The `arcade evals` command supports several options to customize the evaluation process:

- `--details`, `-d`: Show detailed results for each evaluation case, including critic feedback.

Example:



```nextra-code
arcade evals . --details
```

- `--models`, `-m`: Specify the models to use for evaluation. Provide a comma-separated list of model names.

Example:



```nextra-code
arcade evals . --models gpt-4o,gpt-3.5
```

- `--max-concurrent`, `-c`: Set the maximum number of concurrent evaluations to run in parallel.

Example:



```nextra-code
arcade evals . --max-concurrent 4
```

- `--host`, `-h`: Specify the Arcade Engine address to send evaluation requests to.

- `--port`, `-p`: Specify the port of the Arcade Engine.

- `--tls`: Force TLS for the connection to the Arcade Engine.

- `--no-tls`: Disable TLS for the connection to the Arcade Engine.


#### Example Command [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#example-command)

Running evaluations in the `toolkits/math/evals` directory, showing detailed results, using the `gpt-4o` model:

```nextra-code
arcade evals toolkits/math/evals --details --models gpt-4o
```

### Execution Process [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#execution-process)

When you run the `arcade evals` command, the following steps occur:

1. **Preparation**: The CLI loads the evaluation suites from the specified directory, looking for files that match the naming convention.

2. **Execution**: The evaluation suites are executed asynchronously. Each suite’s evaluation function, decorated with `@tool_eval`, is called with the appropriate configuration, including the model and concurrency settings.

3. **Concurrency**: Evaluations can run concurrently based on the `--max-concurrent` setting, improving efficiency.

4. **Result Aggregation**: Results from all evaluation cases and models are collected and aggregated.


### Displaying Results [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#displaying-results)

After the evaluations are complete, the results are displayed in a concise and informative format, similar to testing frameworks like `pytest`. The output includes:

- **Summary**: Shows the total number of cases, how many passed, failed, or issued warnings.

Example:



```nextra-code
Summary -- Total: 5 -- Passed: 4 -- Failed: 1
```

- **Detailed Case Results**: For each evaluation case, the status (PASSED, FAILED, WARNED), the case name, and the score are displayed.

Example:



```nextra-code
PASSED Add two large numbers -- Score: 1.00
FAILED Send DM with ambiguous username -- Score: 0.75
```

- **Critic Feedback**: If the `--details` flag is used, detailed feedback from each critic is provided, highlighting matches, mismatches, and scores for each evaluated field.

Example:



```nextra-code
Details:
user_name:
    Match: False, Score: 0.00/0.50
    Expected: johndoe
    Actual: john_doe
message:
    Match: True, Score: 0.50/0.50
```


### Interpreting the Results [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#interpreting-the-results)

- **Passed**: The evaluation case met or exceeded the fail threshold specified in the rubric.

- **Failed**: The evaluation case did not meet the fail threshold.

- **Warnings**: If the score is between the warn threshold and the fail threshold, a warning is issued.


Use the detailed feedback to understand where the model’s performance can be improved, particularly focusing on mismatches identified by critics.

### Customizing Evaluations [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#customizing-evaluations)

You can customize the evaluation process by adjusting:

- **Rubrics**: Modify fail and warn thresholds, and adjust weights to emphasize different aspects of evaluation.

- **Critics**: Add or modify critics in your evaluation cases to target specific arguments or behaviors.

- **Concurrency**: Adjust the `--max-concurrent` option to optimize performance based on your environment.


### Handling Multiple Models [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#handling-multiple-models)

You can evaluate multiple models in a single run by specifying them in the `--models` option as a comma-separated list. This allows you to compare the performance of different models across the same evaluation suites.

Example:

```nextra-code
arcade evals . --models gpt-4o,gpt-3.5
```

### Considerations [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#considerations)

- **Engine Availability**: Ensure the Arcade Engine is running and accessible. You can specify the host and port if running the engine locally or on a different server.

- **Authentication**: Make sure you are logged in and have the necessary API keys configured.

- **Evaluation Files**: Ensure your evaluation files are correctly named and contain the evaluation suites decorated with `@tool_eval`.


## Conclusion [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/run-evaluations\#conclusion)

Running evaluations using the Arcade CLI provides a powerful and convenient way to assess the tool-calling capabilities of your language models. By leveraging the `arcade evals` command, you can efficiently execute your evaluation suites, analyze results, and iterate on your models and toolkits.

Integrating this evaluation process into your development workflow helps ensure that your models interact with tools as expected, enhances reliability, and builds confidence in deploying actionable language models in production environments.

## Arcade Quickstart Guide
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Quickstart

# Arcade Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with Arcade.dev. First, we will go over Direct Tool Calling, a simple way to call tools directly from your agent.

Direct tool calling is useful in situations where you already know what tool is needed or when there is no prompt for an LLM to interpret and decide on the tool calling. It also gives you full control over what is executed by the Arcade Engine and how.

[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/USoqJOOUP6c?si=ontrjjatjmqMfTHN)

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/quickstart\#prerequisites)

1. Create an [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=call-tools-directly)
2. Get an [Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys) and take note, you’ll need it in the next steps.

### Install the Arcade client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/quickstart\#install-the-arcade-client)

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
pip install arcadepy
```

```nextra-code
npm install @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

### Instantiate and use the client [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/quickstart\#instantiate-and-use-the-client)

PythonJavaScript

Create a new script called `example.py`:

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

# You can also set the `ARCADE_API_KEY` environment variable instead of passing it as a parameter.
client = Arcade(api_key="arcade_api_key")

# Arcade needs a unique identifier for your application user (this could be an email address, a UUID, etc).
# In this example, simply use your email address as the user ID:
user_id = "user@example.com"

# Let's use the `Math.Sqrt` tool from the Arcade Math toolkit to get the square root of a number.
response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="Math.Sqrt",
    input={"a": '625'},
    user_id=user_id,
)

print(f"The square root of 625 is {response.output.value}")

# Now, let's use a tool that requires authentication to star a GitHub repository
auth_response = client.tools.authorize(
tool_name="GitHub.SetStarred",
user_id=user_id,
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print(f"Click this link to authorize: `{auth_response.url}`.  The process will continue once you have authorized the app." )
    # Wait for the user to authorize the app
    client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response.id);

response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="GitHub.SetStarred",
    input={
        "owner": "ArcadeAI",
        "name": "arcade-ai",
        "starred": True,
    },
    user_id=user_id,
)

print(response.output.value)

```

Create a new script called `example.mjs`:

```nextra-code
import Arcade from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

// You can also set the `ARCADE_API_KEY` environment variable instead of passing it as a parameter.
const client = new Arcade({
  apiKey: "arcade_api_key",
});

// Arcade needs a unique identifier for your application user (this could be an email address, a UUID, etc).
// In this example, simply use your email address as the user ID:
let userId = "you@example.com";

// Let's use the `Math.Sqrt` tool from the Arcade Math toolkit to get the square root of a number.
const response_sqrt = await client.tools.execute({
  tool_name: "Math.Sqrt",
  input: { a: "625" },
  user_id: userId,
});

console.log(response_sqrt.output.value);

// Now, let's use a tool that requires authentication

const authResponse = await client.tools.authorize({
  tool_name: "GitHub.SetStarred",
  user_id: userId,
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log(
    `Click this link to authorize: \`${authResponse.url}\`.  The process will continue once you have authorized the app.`,
  );
  // Wait for the user to authorize the app
  await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse.id);
}

const response_github = await client.tools.execute({
  tool_name: "GitHub.SetStarred",
  input: {
    owner: "ArcadeAI",
    name: "arcade-ai",
    starred: true,
  },
  user_id: userId,
});

console.log(response_github.output.value);
```

# Adding user authorization to your tools

In this guide, you’ll learn how to add user authorization to your custom tools, using Arcade.

You’ll create a tool that sends a message on behalf of a user via Slack.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-auth\#prerequisites)

- [Set up Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/quickstart)
- Install the Arcade SDK and any third-party SDKs you need (e.g., Slack SDK):
- [Understand Tool Context](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/tool-context)

uvpip

```nextra-code
uv pip install arcade-ai slack_sdk
```

```nextra-code
pip install arcade-ai slack_sdk
```

### Define your authorized tool [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-auth\#define-your-authorized-tool)

Create a new Python file, e.g., `slack_tools.py`, and import the necessary modules:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Slack
from arcade_tdk.errors import RetryableToolError
from slack_sdk import WebClient
```

Now, define your tool using the `@tool` decorator and specify the required authorization, in this case, by using the built-in `Slack` auth provider:

```nextra-code
@tool(
    requires_auth=Slack(
        scopes=[\
            "chat:write",\
            "im:write",\
            "users.profile:read",\
            "users:read",\
        ],
    )
)
def send_dm_to_user(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_name: Annotated[str, "The Slack username of the person you want to message"],
    message: Annotated[str, "The message you want to send"],
) -> Annotated[str, "A confirmation message that the DM was sent"]:
    """Send a direct message to a user in Slack."""
    slack_client = WebClient(token=context.authorization.token)

    # Retrieve the user ID based on username
    user_list_response = slack_client.users_list()
    user_id = None
    for user in user_list_response["members"]:
        if user["name"].lower() == user_name.lower():
            user_id = user["id"]
            break
    if not user_id:
        raise RetryableToolError(
            "User not found",
            developer_message=f"User with username '{user_name}' not found."
        )

    # Open a conversation and send the message
    im_response = slack_client.conversations_open(users=[user_id])
    dm_channel_id = im_response["channel"]["id"]
    slack_client.chat_postMessage(channel=dm_channel_id, text=message)

    return "DM sent successfully"
```

Arcade offers a number of [built-in auth providers](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers), including Slack, Google, and GitHub. You can also require authorization with a custom auth provider, using the `OAuth2` class, a subclass of the `ToolAuthorization` class:

```nextra-code
@tool(
    requires_auth=OAuth2(
        id="your-oauth-provider-id",
        scopes=["scope1", "scope2"],
    )
)
```

The `OAuth2` class requires an `id` parameter to identify the auth provider in the Arcade Engine. For built-in providers like `Slack`, you can skip the `id` \- the Arcade Engine will find the right provider using your credentials. While you can specify an `id` for built-in providers, only do this for private tools that won’t be shared.

### Use your authorized tool with Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-auth\#use-your-authorized-tool-with-arcade)

Now you can use your custom authorized tool with Arcade in your application.

Here’s an example of how to use your tool:

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Use the tool
response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="Slack.SendDmToUser",
    input={
        "user_name": "johndoe",
        "message": "Hello!",
    },
    user_id=user_id,
)

print(response.output.value)
```

### Handle authorization [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-auth\#handle-authorization)

Since your tool requires authorization, the first time you use it, the user (identified by `user_id`) needs to authorize access.

Arcade handles the authorization flow, prompting the user to visit a URL to grant permissions.

Your application should guide the user through this process.

### How it works [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-auth\#how-it-works)

By specifying the `requires_auth` parameter in the `@tool` decorator, you indicate that the tool needs user authorization.

Arcade manages the OAuth flow, and provides the token in `context.authorization.token` when the tool is executed. Arcade also remembers the user’s authorization tokens, so they won’t have to go through the authorization process again until the auth expires or is revoked.

### Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-auth\#next-steps)

Try adding more authorized tools, or explore how to handle different authorization providers and scopes.

# Creating a Toolkit

This guide walks you through the complete process of creating a custom toolkit for Arcade - from initial setup to publishing on PyPI. You’ll build a simple arithmetic toolkit with operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. When creating or extending an Arcade toolkit, we make it easy to develop the tool alongside your agent, providing a pleasant local development experience. As your agent will be loading its available tools from the Arcade Engine, you can mix existing tools and your locally developed tool by following this guide. You’ll be running your local worker with the Arcade CLI and registering it with the Engine so that your agent can find and use your tool.

[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/EcCb_1W9Gb4?si=rCt30twDTEgoIVi2)

## Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#prerequisites)

Before starting, make sure you have:

- An [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=custom-tools)
- For this guide, we’ll use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as our package manager.

## Generate a toolkit template [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#generate-a-toolkit-template)

Run the following command to start creating your toolkit:

```nextra-code
uv tool run --from arcade-ai arcade new arithmetic
```

Enter the optional information when prompted:

- **Description**: Provide a brief explanation of what your toolkit will do
- **Author GitHub username and email**: Your contact information
- **Generate test and evaluation directories**: Whether you want additional directories created for you

After completion, a directory with your toolkit name (arithmetic) will be created with the following structure:

```nextra-code
arithmetic/
├── arcade_arithmetic/       # Core package directory
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── tools/               # Directory for your tools
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── hello.py         # Example tool
├── evals/                   # Evaluation directory
│   └── eval_arithmetic.py   # Example evaluation file
├── tests/                   # Test directory
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_arithmetic.py   # Example test file
├── pyproject.toml           # uv project configuration
├── README.md
└── Makefile                 # uv helper commands
```

Navigate to your toolkit directory:

```nextra-code
cd arithmetic
```

## Set up the development environment [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#set-up-the-development-environment)

An active virtual environment for your shell(s) is required to run the local development commands.

```nextra-code
uv venv --seed -p 3.13
```

Install dependencies and pre-commit hooks:

```nextra-code
make install
```

This installs all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`, pre-commit hooks for code quality, and your toolkit in development mode.

The Makefile provides several helpful commands:

- `build` \- Build wheel file using uv
- `bump-version` \- Bump the version in the pyproject.toml file by a patch version
- `check` \- Run code quality tools
- `clean-build` \- Clean build artifacts
- `coverage` \- Generate coverage report
- `install` \- Install the uv environment and install all packages with dependencies
- `install-local` \- Install Arcade components (CLI, TDK, etc.) from source in editable mode. Only use this when you are developing against the latest unreleased code from the [arcade-ai repo](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai) main branch instead of the published packages
- `test` \- Test the code with pytest

## Define your tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#define-your-tools)

Create a Python file for your tools in the `arcade_arithmetic/tools` directory.

The following example shows a simple math toolkit with three tools: `add`, `subtract`, and `multiply`:

```nextra-code
# arcade_arithmetic/tools/operations.py
from typing import Annotated

from arcade_tdk import tool


@tool
def add(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The sum of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Add two numbers together

    Examples:
        add(3, 4) -> 7
        add(-1, 5) -> 4
    """
    return a + b

@tool
def subtract(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The difference of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Subtract the second number from the first

    Examples:
        subtract(10, 4) -> 6
        subtract(5, 7) -> -2
    """
    return a - b

@tool
def multiply(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The product of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Multiply two numbers together

    Examples:
        multiply(3, 4) -> 12
        multiply(-2, 5) -> -10
    """
    return a * b
```

Update the package initialization files to expose your tools:

```nextra-code
# arcade_arithmetic/tools/__init__.py
from arcade_arithmetic.tools.operations import add, multiply, subtract

__all__ = ["add", "multiply", "subtract"]
```

```nextra-code
# arcade_arithmetic/__init__.py
from arcade_arithmetic.tools import add, multiply, subtract

__all__ = ["add", "multiply", "subtract"]
```

## Test your toolkit [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#test-your-toolkit)

Write tests for your tools in the `tests` directory:

```nextra-code
# tests/test_operations.py
import pytest

from arcade_arithmetic.tools.operations import add, multiply, subtract


def test_add():
    assert add(3, 4) == 7
    assert add(-1, 5) == 4
    assert add(0, 0) == 0

def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(10, 4) == 6
    assert subtract(5, 7) == -2
    assert subtract(0, 0) == 0

def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(3, 4) == 12
    assert multiply(-2, 5) == -10
    assert multiply(0, 5) == 0
```

Run the tests:

```nextra-code
make test
```

Check code quality:

```nextra-code
make check
```

Generate a coverage report (optional):

```nextra-code
make coverage
```

## Verify local installation [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#verify-local-installation)

Your toolkit should already be installed locally from the `make install` command. Verify it’s properly registered:

```nextra-code
arcade show --local
```

You should see your toolkit listed in the output.

## Test your tools locally [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#test-your-tools-locally)

Serve your toolkit locally with the Arcade CLI:

```nextra-code
arcade serve
```

You can use the `--reload` flag to automatically reload the server when you make changes to your toolkit:

```nextra-code
arcade serve --reload
```

Visit [http://localhost:8002/worker/health](http://localhost:8002/worker/health) to see that your worker is running.

## Connect your toolkit to the Arcade Engine [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#connect-your-toolkit-to-the-arcade-engine)

In another terminal, use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/), [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel), or [cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/create-local-tunnel/) to give your local worker a public URL.

ngrokTailscaleCloudflare

```nextra-code
ngrok http 8002
```

```nextra-code
tailscale funnel 8002
```

```nextra-code
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8002
```

Then in your Arcade dashboard:

1. Navigate to the [Workers](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/workers) page.
2. Click **Add Worker**.
3. Fill in the form with the following values:
   - **ID**: `my-arithmetic-worker`
   - **Worker Type**: `Arcade`
   - **URL**: your public URL from ngrok, tailscale, or cloudflare
   - **Secret**: `dev`
   - **Timeout** and **Retry**: can be left at default values
4. Click **Create**.

Now, in the [Playground](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/playground), you can see your tools in action.

## Deploy your toolkit to the Arcade Engine [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#deploy-your-toolkit-to-the-arcade-engine)

Alternatively, you can deploy your toolkit to Arcade’s cloud instead of tunneling to it locally.

Find the `worker.toml` file in your toolkit’s root directory (where you ran `uv tool run --from arcade-ai arcade new arithmetic`):

```nextra-code
[[worker]]

[worker.config]
id = "demo-worker"  # Choose a unique ID
enabled = true
timeout = 30
retries = 3
secret = "<your-secret>"  # This is randomly generated for you by `uv tool run --from arcade-ai arcade new arithmetic`
[worker.local_source]
packages = ["./arithmetic"]  # Path to your toolkit directory
```

See [Configuring Arcade Deploy](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy) for more configuration options.

From the root of your toolkit, deploy your toolkit to Arcade’s cloud with:

This may take a while your first time.

```nextra-code
arcade deploy
```

Verify the deployment:

```nextra-code
arcade worker list
```

## Package and publish to PyPI [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#package-and-publish-to-pypi)

Clean any previous build artifacts:

```nextra-code
make clean-build
```

If you’re updating an existing package, bump the version:

```nextra-code
make bump-version
```

Create a comprehensive README.md file that explains your toolkit’s purpose, installation, and usage.

Build your package:

```nextra-code
make build
```

Publish to PyPI:

```nextra-code
uv publish --token YOUR_PYPI_TOKEN_HERE
```

## Using your published toolkit [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#using-your-published-toolkit)

Now that your toolkit is published, you can use it in any Arcade application:

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

# Initialize the Arcade client
client = Arcade()

# Use your Tools
response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="Arithmetic.Add",
    input={
        "a": 12,
        "b": 34
    },
)

print(response.output.value)
```

## Ongoing toolkit maintenance [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit\#ongoing-toolkit-maintenance)

As you continue to develop your toolkit, use these Makefile commands to maintain it:

- `make check` \- Run code quality checks before committing changes
- `make test` \- Run tests to ensure your changes don’t break existing functionality
- `make coverage` \- Monitor test coverage as you add new features
- `make bump-version` \- Update the version when releasing new changes
- `make build` \- Build new distribution packages
- `make clean-build` \- Clean up build artifacts when needed

## LinkedIn Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Linkedin

# LinkedIn auth provider

The LinkedIn auth provider enables tools and agents to call the LinkedIn API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the LinkedIn auth provider seamlessly manage LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure LinkedIn auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin#using-linkedin-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call LinkedIn APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin#using-linkedin-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call LinkedIn APIs

## Configuring LinkedIn auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#configuring-linkedin-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own LinkedIn app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own LinkedIn credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your LinkedIn app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a LinkedIn app.

### Create a LinkedIn app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#create-a-linkedin-app)

- Follow LinkedIn’s guide to [setting up user authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authentication)
- On the Products tab, add the products you need for your app (e.g. “Share on LinkedIn”)
  - At a minimum, you _must_ add the “Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect” product
- On the Auth tab, set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the LinkedIn app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own LinkedIn Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#configuring-your-own-linkedin-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your LinkedIn app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure LinkedIn Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **LinkedIn**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-linkedin-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your LinkedIn app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require LinkedIn auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this LinkedIn OAuth provider. If you have multiple LinkedIn providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring LinkedIn auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `linkedin` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-linkedin
      description: "The default LinkedIn provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: linkedin
      client_id: ${env:LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using LinkedIn auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#using-linkedin-auth-in-app-code)

Use the LinkedIn auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for LinkedIn APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for LinkedIn APIs:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
import requests

from arcadepy import Arcade


client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

"""
In this example, we will use Arcade to authenticate with LinkedIn and post a
message to the user's LinkedIn feed.

There is a tool for that in the Arcade SDK, which simplifies the process for
you to post messages to the user's LinkedIn feed either through our Python or
JavaScript SDKs or via LLM tool calling.

Below we are just showing how to use Arcade as an auth provider, if you ever
need to.
"""

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="linkedin",
    scopes=["w_member_social"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

## Using LinkedIn auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin\#using-linkedin-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with LinkedIn APIs.

Use the `LinkedIn()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with LinkedIn. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s LinkedIn token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk.errors import ToolExecutionError
from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import LinkedIn


@tool(
    requires_auth=LinkedIn(
        scopes=["w_member_social"],
    )
)
async def create_text_post(
    context: ToolContext,
    text: Annotated[str, "The text content of the post"],
) -> Annotated[str, "URL of the shared post"]:
    """Share a new text post to LinkedIn."""
    endpoint = "/ugcPosts"

    # The LinkedIn user ID is required to create a post, even though we're using the user's access token.
    # Arcade Engine gets the current user's info from LinkedIn and automatically populates context.authorization.user_info.
    # LinkedIn calls the user ID "sub" in their user_info data payload. See:
    # https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/consumer/integrations/self-serve/sign-in-with-linkedin-v2#api-request-to-retreive-member-details
    user_id = context.authorization.user_info.get("sub")
    if not user_id:
        raise ToolExecutionError(
            "User ID not found.",
            developer_message="User ID not found in `context.authorization.user_info.sub`",
        )

    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    author_id = f"urn:li:person:{user_id}"
    payload = {
        "author": author_id,
        "lifecycleState": "PUBLISHED",
        "specificContent": {
            "com.linkedin.ugc.ShareContent": {
                "shareCommentary": {"text": text},
                "shareMediaCategory": "NONE",
            }
        },
        "visibility": {"com.linkedin.ugc.MemberNetworkVisibility": "PUBLIC"},
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(

## Custom Docker Worker Guide
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Serve tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/arcade-deploy "Serve tools") Docker

# Build custom worker images with docker

This guide shows you how to build a custom Worker image using Arcade’s base Worker image. It takes you through creating a Dockerfile, installing toolkits, and running the resulting container.

### Requirements [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/docker-worker\#requirements)

- Docker installed on your machine

### Create your Dockerfile [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/docker-worker\#create-your-dockerfile)

Create a Dockerfile in your project directory:

```nextra-code
ARG VERSION=latest

FROM ghcr.io/arcadeai/worker-base:${VERSION}

# Copy the file that lists all your desired toolkits
COPY toolkits.txt ./

# Install these toolkits
RUN pip install -r toolkits.txt
```

With this Dockerfile, we start from the Arcade worker base image, copy in a file named toolkits.txt, and install each toolkit listed there.

* * *

## List Your Toolkits [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/docker-worker\#list-your-toolkits)

Create a file named toolkits.txt in the same directory. Add the toolkits you want installed:

```nextra-code
arcade-google
arcade-web
arcade-zoom
```

Adjust this file as needed. Each line in toolkits.txt should specify a Python package name and version.

* * *

## 3\. Build the Image [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/docker-worker\#3-build-the-image)

From the directory containing the Dockerfile and toolkits.txt, run:

```nextra-code
docker build -t custom-worker:0.1.0 .
```

This command creates a Docker image named custom-worker with the tag 0.1.0 using the instructions in your Dockerfile.

* * *

## Run the Worker [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/docker-worker\#run-the-worker)

To start the worker container:

```nextra-code
docker run -p 8002:8002 \
  -e ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET="your_secret_here" \
  custom-worker:0.1.0
```

Replace “your\_secret\_here” with a secret of your choice. Your engine will need access to this secret to call your worker. The worker will be accessible on port 8002 of your local machine.

* * *

## Next Steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/docker-worker\#next-steps)

- Set environment variables (like ARCADE\_WORKER\_SECRET) securely for production use.
- Deploy your container to a suitable environment (Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or another container orchestration platform).

Happy coding with Arcade!

with us](mailto:contact@arcade.dev) to request a new tool, or [create your\\
own tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).

## search.SearchShoppingProducts [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/google_shopping\#searchsearchshoppingproducts)

See Example >

Search for products on Google Shopping.

**Parameters**

- **keywords** _(string, required)_ Keywords to search for. E.g. ‘apple iphone’ or ‘samsung galaxy’
- **`country_code`** _(string, optional, Defaults to ‘us’ United States)_ 2-character country code to use in the Google Shopping search. A list of supported country codes can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#countrycodes).

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/google_shopping\#auth)

The Arcade Google Shopping Search toolkit uses the [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) to get product information from Google Shopping.

- **Secret:**
  - `SERP_API_KEY`: Your SerpAPI API key.

Setting the `SERP_API_KEY` secret is only required if you are [self-hosting](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview) Arcade. If you’re using Arcade Cloud, the secret is already set for you. To manage your secrets, go to the [Secrets page](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/secrets) in the Arcade Dashboard.

## Default parameter values [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/google_shopping\#default-parameter-values)

Language and Country are configurable through environment variables. When set, they will be used as default for YouTube tools.

Providing a different value as `language_code` or `country_code` argument in a tool call will override the default value set in the environment variables.

**Language**

The language code is a 2-character code that determines the language in which the API will search and return video information. There are two environment variables:

- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_LANGUAGE`: a default value for all Google Search tools. If not set, defaults to ‘en’ (English).
- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_SHOPPING_LANGUAGE`: a default value for the Google Shopping Search tools. If not set, defaults to `ARCADE_GOOGLE_LANGUAGE`.

A list of supported language codes can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#languagecodes).

**Country**

The country code is a 2-character code that determines the country in which the API will search for videos:

- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_COUNTRY`: a default value for all Google Search tools. If not set, defaults to `None`.
- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_SHOPPING_COUNTRY`: a default value for the Google Shopping Search tools. If not set, defaults to `ARCADE_GOOGLE_COUNTRY`. If `ARCADE_GOOGLE_COUNTRY` is not set, the default country for Google Shopping tools will be `us` (United States).

A list of supported country codes can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#countrycodes).

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/google_maps\#auth)

The Arcade Google Maps toolkit uses the [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) to get directions.

- **Secret:**
  - `SERP_API_KEY`: Your SerpAPI API key.

Setting the `SERP_API_KEY` secret is only required if you are [self-hosting](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview) Arcade. If you’re using Arcade Cloud, the secret is already set for you. To manage your secrets, go to the [Secrets page](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/secrets) in the Arcade Dashboard.

## Default parameters [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/google_maps\#default-parameters)

Language, Country, Distance Unit, and Travel Mode are configurable through environment variables. When set, they will be used as default for Google Maps tools.

Providing a different value as `language`, `country`, `distance_unit`, or `travel_mode` argument in a tool call will override the default value.

**Language**

The language code is a 2-character code that determines the language in which the API will search and return directions. There are two environment variables:

- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_LANGUAGE`: a default value for all Google tools. If not set, defaults to ‘en’ (English).
- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_MAPS_LANGUAGE`: a default value for the Google Maps tools. If not set, defaults to `ARCADE_GOOGLE_LANGUAGE`.

A list of supported language codes can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#languagecodes).

**Country**

The country code is a 2-character code that determines the country in which the API will search for directions:

- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_MAPS_COUNTRY`: a default value for the Google Maps tools. If not set, defaults to `None`.

A list of supported country codes can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#countrycodes).

**Distance Unit**

The distance unit is a string that determines the unit of distance to use in the Google Maps search:

- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_MAPS_DISTANCE_UNIT`: a default value for the Google Maps tools. If not set, defaults to `GoogleMapsDistanceUnit.KM`.

A list of supported distance units can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#googlemapsdistanceunit).

**Travel Mode**

The travel mode is a string that determines the mode of travel to use in the Google Maps search:

- `ARCADE_GOOGLE_MAPS_TRAVEL_MODE`: a default value for the Google Maps tools. If not set, defaults to `GoogleMapsTravelMode.BEST`.

A list of supported travel modes can be found [here](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/search/reference#googlemapstravelmode).

- **Secret:**
  - `SERP_API_KEY`: Your SerpAPI API key.

Setting the `SERP_API_KEY` secret is only required if you are [self-hosting](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/overview) Arcade. If you’re using Arcade Cloud, the secret is already set for you. To manage your secrets, go to the [Secrets page](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/secrets) in the Arcade Dashboard.

## Slack Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") Slack

# Slack auth provider

The Slack auth provider enables tools and agents to call [Slack APIs](https://api.slack.com/docs) on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Slack auth provider seamlessly manage Slack OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

Want to quickly get started with Slack in your agent or AI app? The pre-built
[Arcade Slack toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/slack) is what you want!

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Slack auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Slack toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/slack), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Slack
- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack#using-slack-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the Slack API
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack#using-slack-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the Slack API

## Configuring Slack auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#configuring-slack-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Slack app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own Slack credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Slack app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Slack app.

### Create a Slack app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#create-a-slack-app)

In May 29, 2025, [Slack announced](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2025-05-terms-rate-limit-update-and-faq) changes to their API rate-limits and terms of service for apps that are not approved for the Slack Marketplace.

The `conversations.history` and `conversations.replies` endpoints are now limited to 1 request/minute and up to 15 objects returned per request. This affects various tools in the [Arcade Slack toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/slack). Additionally, the [API Terms of Service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api) now requires [Slack Marketplace](https://api.slack.com/slack-marketplace/using) approval for commercial distribution.

- Follow Slack’s guide to [registering a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/quickstart)
- Choose the scopes (permissions) you need for your app
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

Next, add the Slack app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Slack Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#configuring-your-own-slack-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your Slack app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure Slack Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Slack**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-slack-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Slack app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require Slack auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Slack OAuth provider. If you have multiple Slack providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Slack auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export SLACK_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
SLACK_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `slack` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-slack
      description: "The default Slack provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: slack
      client_id: ${env:SLACK_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using Slack auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#using-slack-auth-in-app-code)

Use the Slack auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Slack API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Slack API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="slack",
    scopes=[\
        "chat:write",\
        "im:write",\
        "users.profile:read",\
        "users:read",\
    ],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "user@example.com";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "slack", {
  scopes: ["chat:write", "im:write", "users.profile:read", "users:read"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Slack auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/slack\#using-slack-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can use the pre-built [Arcade Slack toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/slack) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Slack.

If the pre-built tools in the Slack toolkit don’t meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Slack API.

Use the `Slack()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Slack. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Slack token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

from slack_sdk import WebClient

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Slack
from arcade_tdk.errors import RetryableToolError


@tool(
    requires_auth=Slack(
        scopes=[\
            "chat:write",\
            "im:write",\
            "users.profile:read",\
            "users:read",\
        ],
    )
)
def send_dm_to_user(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_name: Annotated[\
        str,\
        "The Slack username of the person you want to message. Slack usernames are ALWAYS lowercase.",\
    ],
    message: Annotated[str, "The message you want to send"],
):
    """Send a direct message to a user in Slack."""

    slackClient = WebClient(token=context.authorization.token)

    # Retrieve the user's Slack ID based on their username
    userListResponse = slackClient.users_list()
    user_id = None
    for user in userListResponse["members"]:
        if user["name"].lower() == user_name.lower():
            user_id = user["id"]
            break

    if not user_id:
        raise RetryableToolError(
            "User not found",
            developer_message=f"User with username '{user_name}' not found.",
        )

    # Step 2: Retrieve the DM channel ID with the user
    im_response = slackClient.conversations_open(users=[user_id])
    dm_channel_id = im_response["channel"]["id"]

    # Step 3: Send the message as if it's from you (because we're using a user token)
    slackClient.chat_postMessage(channel=dm_channel_id, text=message)
```

# Microsoft auth provider

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Microsoft Auth Provider. To use
Microsoft auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Microsoft
OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Microsoft auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Microsoft Graph API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Microsoft auth provider seamlessly manage Microsoft OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/microsoft\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure Microsoft auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

## Arcade Registry Overview
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") Registry Early Access

# The Arcade Registry

The **Arcade Registry** is how agentic tool developers share their work with the world. Arcade.dev is collecting all the integrations that agents will ever need in one place - think HuggingFace or Pypi but for LLM tools. A powerful community of open source and for-profit developers building out robust and evaluated workflows is how agents can be elevated to being _truly_ useful.

Take the survey

**_The components of the Arcade Registry_**![The Arcade Registry diagram](https://docs.arcade.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fregistry.d8b58aa5.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7X7SFSaKe9V7iRHd3Et4a6gD5tMs)

Unlike traditional read-only tool libraries, Arcade.dev couples the runtime with the registry. This way we can collect real metrics and usage information about your tools, sharing meaningful information and feedback back to the developers. You’ll get error reports and statistics about how your tools are getting used. Arcade.dev also makes it possible for developers to optionally choose to sell their tools with a markup on top of the Arcade platform fees.

Thanks to the Arcade Engine, your toolkits will be available via all the protocols Arcade supports - be that MCP for locally-running applications, OXP for server applications, and whatever comes next. Use the open-source Arcade SDKs to future-proof your tools.

We are seeking beta testers who are interested in building, maintaining, and sharing toolkits with the world in either a free-to-use or for-profit manner. Sign up today to join the Arcade Registry Beta.

## Using Arcade Tools
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [OpenAI Agents](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/overview "OpenAI Agents") Using Arcade tools

## Use Arcade with OpenAI Agents [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#use-arcade-with-openai-agents)

In this guide, let’s explore how to integrate Arcade tools into your OpenAI Agents application. Follow the step-by-step instructions below.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#prerequisites)

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys)

### Set up your environment [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#set-up-your-environment)

Install the required packages, and ensure your environment variables are set with your Arcade API key:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
pip install agents-arcade arcadepy
```

```nextra-code
npm install @openai/agents @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

### Configure API keys [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#configure-api-keys)

Provide your Arcade API key. You can store it in environment variables or directly in your code:

> Need an Arcade API key? Visit the [Get an API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys) page to create one.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
import os

os.environ["ARCADE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY"
# Or set it directly when initializing the client
```

```nextra-code
# In your .env file
ARCADE_API_KEY=YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY
```

### Create and manage Arcade tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#create-and-manage-arcade-tools)

PythonJavaScript

Use the `get_arcade_tools` function to retrieve tools from specific toolkits:

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools

# Initialize the Arcade client
client = AsyncArcade()

# Get all tools from the "Google" toolkit
tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["google"])

# You can request multiple toolkits at once
tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["google", "github", "linkedin"])

# You can request specific tools
tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, tools=["Google_ListEmails", "Slack_ListUsers", "Slack_SendDmToUser"])
```

```nextra-code
import Arcade from '@arcadeai/arcadejs';
import { executeOrAuthorizeZodTool, toZod } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";
import { tool } from '@openai/agents';

const client = new Arcade();

// Option 1: Get tools from a single toolkit
const googleTools = await client.tools.list({ toolkit: "google", limit: 30 });
const toolsFromGoogle = googleTools.items;

// Option 2: Get tools from multiple toolkits
const [google, github, linkedin] = await Promise.all([\
  client.tools.list({ toolkit: "google", limit: 30 }),\
  client.tools.list({ toolkit: "github", limit: 30 }),\
  client.tools.list({ toolkit: "linkedin", limit: 30 })\
]);
const toolsFromMultiple = [...google.items, ...github.items, ...linkedin.items];

// Option 3: Get specific tools by name
const specificTools = await Promise.all([\
  client.tools.get("Google_ListEmails"),\
  client.tools.get("Slack_ListUsers"),\
  client.tools.get("Slack_SendDmToUser"),\
]);

// Convert any of the above to OpenAI Agents format
const convertToAgents = (arcadeTools) => {
  return toZod({
    tools: arcadeTools,
    client,
    userId: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID>", // Replace this with your application's user ID (e.g. email address, UUID, etc.)
    executeFactory: executeOrAuthorizeZodTool,
  }).map(tool);
};

// Use with any of the options above
const tools = convertToAgents(toolsFromGoogle); // or toolsFromMultiple or specificTools
```

### Set up the agent with Arcade tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#set-up-the-agent-with-arcade-tools)

Create an agent and provide it with the Arcade tools:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from agents import Agent, Runner

# Create an agent with Google tools
google_agent = Agent(
    name="Google agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Google API calls.",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    tools=tools,
)
```

```nextra-code
import { Agent, Runner, tool } from '@openai/agents';

// Create an agent with Arcade tools
const googleAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Google agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Google API calls.",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  tools
});
```

### Run the agent [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#run-the-agent)

PythonJavaScript

Run the agent, providing a user\_id for tool authorization:

```nextra-code
try:
    result = await Runner.run(
        starting_agent=google_agent,
        input="What are my latest emails?",
        context={"user_id": "user@example.com"},
    )
    print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
except AuthorizationError as e:
    print("Please Login to Google:", e)
```

```nextra-code
const result = await run(googleAgent, "What are my latest emails?");
```

### Handle authentication [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#handle-authentication)

PythonJavaScript

If a tool requires authorization, an `AuthorizationError` will be raised with an authorization URL:

```nextra-code
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError

try:
    # Run agent code from earlier examples
    # ...
except AuthorizationError as e:
    print(f"Please visit this URL to authorize: {e}")
    # The URL contained in the error will take the user to the authorization page
```

If a tool requires authorization, the agent will show a message like this:

```nextra-code
[Authorize Gmail Access](https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?access_type=offline...)
Once you have authorized access, I can retrieve your latest emails.
```

### Complete example [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#complete-example)

Here’s a complete example putting everything together:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
from agents import Agent, Runner
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade

from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError


async def main():
    client = AsyncArcade()
    tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["google"])

    google_agent = Agent(
        name="Google agent",
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Google API calls.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=tools,
    )

    try:
        result = await Runner.run(
            starting_agent=google_agent,
            input="What are my latest emails?",
            context={"user_id": "user@example.com"},
        )
        print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
    except AuthorizationError as e:
        print("Please Login to Google:", e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(main())
```

Check out the complete working example in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/tree/main/examples/openai-agents-ts/src/index.ts).

```nextra-code
import Arcade from '@arcadeai/arcadejs';
import { executeOrAuthorizeZodTool, toZod } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";
import { Agent, run, tool } from '@openai/agents';

// 1) Initialize Arcade client
const client = new Arcade();

// 2) Fetch Google toolkit from Arcade and prepare tools for OpenAI Agents
const googleToolkit = await client.tools.list({ toolkit: "google", limit: 30 });
const tools = toZod({
  tools: googleToolkit.items,
  client,
  userId: "<YOUR_SYSTEM_USER_ID>", // Replace this with your application's user ID (e.g. email address, UUID, etc.)
  executeFactory: executeOrAuthorizeZodTool,
}).map(tool);

// 3) Create a new agent with the Google toolkit
const googleAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Google agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Google API calls.",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  tools
});

// 4) Run the agent
const result = await run(googleAgent, "What are my latest emails?");

// 5) Print the result
console.log(result.finalOutput);
```

## Tips for selecting tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#tips-for-selecting-tools)

- **Relevance**: Pick only the tools you need. Avoid using all tools at once.
- **User identification**: Always provide a unique and consistent `user_id` for each user. Use your internal or database user ID, not something entered by the user.

## Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#next-steps)

Now that you have integrated Arcade tools into your OpenAI Agents application, you can:

- Experiment with different toolkits, such as “github” or “linkedin”
- Customize the agent’s instructions for specific tasks
- Try out multi-agent systems using different Arcade tools
- Build your own custom tools with the Arcade Tool SDK

Enjoy exploring Arcade and building powerful AI-enabled Python applications!

## User Authorization Workflow
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [LangChain](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/use-arcade-tools "LangChain") User authorization

## User Authorization in LangGraph [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/user-auth-interrupts\#user-authorization-in-langgraph)

In this guide, you will create a LangGraph workflow that requires user authorization before running certain Arcade tools. When a tool needs authorization, the graph displays an authorization URL and waits for the user’s approval. This ensures that only the tools you explicitly authorize are available to the language model. For complete working examples, see our [Python](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/blob/main/examples/langchain/langgraph_with_user_auth.py) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/blob/main/examples/langchain-ts/langgraph-with-user-auth.ts) examples.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/user-auth-interrupts\#prerequisites)

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys)

### Install the required packages [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/user-auth-interrupts\#install-the-required-packages)

Set up your environment with the following installations:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
pip install langchain-arcade langchain-openai langgraph
```

```nextra-code
npm install @arcadeai/arcadejs @langchain/openai @langchain/core @langchain/langgraph
```

### Configure your Arcade environment [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/user-auth-interrupts\#configure-your-arcade-environment)

Make sure you have set your Arcade API key (and any other relevant keys) in the environment, or assign them directly in the code:

> Need an Arcade API key? Visit the [Get an API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys) page to create one.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
import os

# Import necessary classes and modules
from langchain_arcade import ArcadeToolManager
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import END, START, MessagesState, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

arcade_api_key = os.environ["ARCADE_API_KEY"]

# Initialize the tool manager and fetch tools compatible with langgraph
tool_manager = ArcadeToolManager(api_key=arcade_api_key)
tools = tool_manager.get_tools(toolkits=["Google"])
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Create a language model instance and bind it with the tools
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools)
```

Here are the main code elements:

- arcade\_api\_key is your Arcade key.
- tool\_manager fetches your Arcade tools, for example the “Google” toolkit.
- tool\_node encapsulates these tools for usage in LangGraph.
- model\_with\_tools binds your tools to the “gpt-4o” language model, enabling tool calls.

```nextra-code
import { pathToFileURL } from "node:url";
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";
import { toZod } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";
import type { AIMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { MessagesAnnotation, StateGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { ToolNode } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

// Initialize Arcade with API key from environment
const arcade = new Arcade();

// Replace with your application's user ID (e.g. email address, UUID, etc.)
const USER_ID = "user@example.com";

// Initialize tools from Google toolkit
const googleToolkit = await arcade.tools.list({ toolkit: "google", limit: 30 });
const arcadeTools = toZod({
	tools: googleToolkit.items,
	client: arcade,
	userId: USER_ID,
});

// Convert Arcade tools to LangGraph tools
const tools = arcadeTools.map(({ name, description, execute, parameters }) =>
	tool(execute, {
		name,
		description,
		schema: parameters,
	}),
);

// Initialize the prebuilt tool node
const toolNode = new ToolNode(tools);

// Create a language model instance and bind it with the tools
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
	model: "gpt-4o",
	apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const modelWithTools = model.bindTools(tools);
```

Here are the main code elements:

- arcade.tools.list fetches your Arcade tools, for example the “Google” toolkit.
- toZod converts Arcade tools to Zod schemas, which are required by LangGraph.
- ToolNode encapsulates these tools for usage in LangGraph.
- modelWithTools binds your tools to the “gpt-4o” language model, enabling tool calls.

### Define the workflow steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/user-auth-interrupts\#define-the-workflow-steps)

You will create three primary functions to handle AI interaction, tool authorization, and flow control.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
# Function to invoke the model and get a response
def call_agent(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    # Return the updated message history
    return {"messages": [response]}


# Function to determine the next step in the workflow based on the last message
def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    if state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
        for tool_call in state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
            if tool_manager.requires_auth(tool_call["name"]):
                return "authorization"
        return "tools"  # Proceed to tool execution if no authorization is needed
    return END  # End the workflow if no tool calls are present


# Function to handle authorization for tools that require it
def authorize(state: MessagesState, config: dict):
    user_id = config["configurable"].get("user_id")
    for tool_call in state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
        tool_name = tool_call["name"]
        if not tool_manager.requires_auth(tool_name):
            continue
        auth_response = tool_manager.authorize(tool_name, user_id)
        if auth_response.status != "completed":
            # Prompt the user to visit the authorization URL
            print(f"Visit the following URL to authorize: {auth_response.url}")

            # Wait for the user to complete the authorization
            # and then check the authorization status again
            tool_manager.wait_for_auth(auth_response.id)
            if not tool_manager.is_authorized(auth_response.id):
                # This stops execution if authorization fails
                raise ValueError("Authorization failed")

    return {"messages": []}
```

Explanations for these functions:

- call\_agent: Invokes the language model using the latest conversation state.
- should\_continue: Checks the last AI message for any tool calls. If a tool requires authorization, the flow transitions to authorization. Otherwise, it goes straight to tool execution or ends if no tools are called.
- authorize: Prompts the user to authorize any required tools, blocking until authorization is completed successfully or fails.

```nextra-code
// Function to check if a tool requires authorization
async function requiresAuth(toolName: string): Promise<{
	needsAuth: boolean;
	id: string;
	authUrl: string;
}> {
	const authResponse = await arcade.tools.authorize({
		tool_name: toolName,
		user_id: USER_ID,
	});
	return {
		needsAuth: authResponse.status === "pending",
		id: authResponse.id ?? "",
		authUrl: authResponse.url ?? "",
	};
}

// Function to invoke the model and get a response
async function callAgent(
	state: typeof MessagesAnnotation.State,
): Promise<typeof MessagesAnnotation.Update> {
	const messages = state.messages;
	const response = await modelWithTools.invoke(messages);
	return { messages: [response] };
}

// Function to determine the next step in the workflow based on the last message
async function shouldContinue(
	state: typeof MessagesAnnotation.State,
): Promise<string> {
	const lastMessage = state.messages[state.messages.length - 1] as AIMessage;
	if (lastMessage.tool_calls?.length) {
		for (const toolCall of lastMessage.tool_calls) {
			const { needsAuth } = await requiresAuth(toolCall.name);
			if (needsAuth) {
				return "authorization";
			}
		}
		return "tools"; // Proceed to tool execution if no authorization is needed
	}
	return "__end__"; // End the workflow if no tool calls are present
}

// Function to handle authorization for tools that require it
async function authorize(
	state: typeof MessagesAnnotation.State,
): Promise<typeof MessagesAnnotation.Update> {
	const lastMessage = state.messages[state.messages.length - 1] as AIMessage;
	for (const toolCall of lastMessage.tool_calls || []) {
		const toolName = toolCall.name;
		const { needsAuth, id, authUrl } = await requiresAuth(toolName);
		if (needsAuth) {
			// Prompt the user to visit the authorization URL
			console.log(`Visit the following URL to authorize: ${authUrl}`);

			// Wait for the user to complete the authorization
			const response = await arcade.auth.waitForCompletion(id);
			if (response.status !== "completed") {
				throw new Error("Authorization failed");
			}
		}
	}

	return { messages: [] };
}
```

Explanations for these functions:

- requiresAuth: Checks if a tool requires authorization.
- callAgent: Invokes the language model using the latest conversation state.
- shouldContinue: Checks the last AI message for any tool calls. If a tool requires authorization, the flow transitions to authorization. Otherwise, it goes straight to tool execution or ends if no tools are called.
- authorize: Prompts the user to authorize any required tools, blocking until authorization is completed successfully or fails.

### Build and compile your LangGraph workflow [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/user-auth-interrupts\#build-and-compile-your-langgraph-workflow)

Use StateGraph to assemble the nodes and edges, then compile the graph with a MemorySaver.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Build the workflow graph using StateGraph
    workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

    # Add nodes (steps) to the graph
    workflow.add_node("agent", call_agent)
    workflow.add_node("tools", tool_node)
    workflow.add_node("authorization", authorize)

    # Define the edges and control flow between nodes
    workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
    workflow.add_conditional_edges("agent", should_continue, ["authorization", "tools", END])
    workflow.add_edge("authorization", "tools")
    workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")

    # Set up memory for checkpointing the state
    memory = MemorySaver()

    # Compile the graph with the checkpointer
    graph = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

```nextra-code
// Build the workflow graph
const workflow = new StateGraph(MessagesAnnotation)
	.addNode("agent", callAgent)
	.addNode("tools", toolNode)
	.addNode("authorization", authorize)
	.addEdge("__start__", "agent")
	.addConditionalEdges("agent", shouldContinue, [\
		"authorization",\
		"tools",\
		"__end__",\
	])
	.addEdge("authorization", "tools")
	.addEdge("tools", "agent");

// Compile the graph
const graph = workflow.compile();
```

### Provide inputs and run the graph [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/user-auth-interrupts\#provide-inputs-and-run-the-graph)

Finally, define user-supplied messages, authorization config, and stream the outputs. The graph will pause for any required tool authorization.

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
# Define the input messages from the user
inputs = {
    "messages": [\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Check and see if I have any important emails in my inbox",\
        }\
    ],
}

# Configuration with thread and user IDs for authorization purposes
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "4", "user_id": "user@example.com"}}

# Run the graph and stream the outputs
for chunk in graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="values"):
    # Pretty-print the last message in the chunk
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```nextra-code
const inputs = {
    messages: [\
        {\
            role: "user",\
            content: "Check and see if I have any important emails in my inbox",\
        },\
    ],
};
// Run the graph and stream the outputs
const stream = await graph.stream(inputs, { streamMode: "values" });
for await (const chunk of stream) {
    // Print the last message in the chunk
    console.log(chunk.messages[chunk.messages.length - 1].content);
}
```

In this example:

- The user prompts the agent to check emails.
- The message triggers a potential need for the “Google” tools.
- If authorization is required, the code prints a URL and waits until you permit the tool call.

## Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/langchain/user-auth-interrupts\#next-steps)

- Experiment with more Arcade toolkits for expanded capabilities.
- Explore advanced authorization logic, such as multi-user or role-based checks.
- Integrate additional nodes to handle more complex flows or multi-step tasks in your LangGraph.

By combining Arcade’s authorization features with stateful management in LangGraph, you can build AI-driven workflows that respect user permissions at every step. Have fun exploring Arcade!

## GitHub Auth Provider
[Home](https://docs.arcade.dev/home "Home") [Customizing Auth](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers "Customizing Auth") GitHub

# GitHub auth provider

The GitHub auth provider enables tools and agents to call [GitHub APIs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api) on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the GitHub auth provider seamlessly manage GitHub OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

Want to quickly get started with GitHub in your agent or AI app? The pre-built
[Arcade GitHub toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/development/github/github) is what you want!

### What’s documented here [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#whats-documented-here)

This page describes how to use and configure GitHub auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade GitHub toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/development/github/github), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with GitHub
- Your [app code](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github#using-github-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the GitHub API
- Or, your [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github#using-github-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the GitHub API

## Configuring GitHub auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#configuring-github-auth)

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own GitHub app credentials. This way, your users will see your application’s name requesting permission.

You can use your own GitHub credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your GitHub app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a GitHub app.

### Create a GitHub app [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#create-a-github-app)

- Follow GitHub’s guide to [registering a GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app)
- Choose the permissions you need for your app
  - At a minimum, you must enable read-only access to the Account > Email addresses permission
  - To access repo data, you must enable at least the Repository > Contents permission
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Leave “Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation” **unchecked**
- Leave “Setup URL” blank and “Redirect on update” **unchecked**
- Ensure Optional features > User-to-server token expiration is enabled
- Copy the client ID and generate a client secret to use below

If you need to access private repositories in an organization, you must also:

1. Make the app public via Advanced > Make public
2. Add the app to the organization via Install app

Next, add the GitHub app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own GitHub Auth Provider in Arcade [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#configuring-your-own-github-auth-provider-in-arcade)

There are two ways to configure your GitHub app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

Dashboard GUIEngine Configuration YAML

### Configure GitHub Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#access-the-arcade-dashboard)

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#navigate-to-the-oauth-providers-page)

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **GitHub**.

#### Enter the provider details [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#enter-the-provider-details)

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-github-provider”).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your GitHub app.

#### Create the provider [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#create-the-provider)

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

When you use tools that require GitHub auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this GitHub OAuth provider. If you have multiple GitHub providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring GitHub auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

### Set environment variables [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#set-environment-variables)

Set the following environment variables:

```nextra-code
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```nextra-code
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

See [Engine configuration](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.

### Edit the Engine configuration [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#edit-the-engine-configuration)

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `github` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```nextra-code
auth:
  providers:
    - id: default-github
      description: "The default GitHub provider"
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      provider_id: github
      client_id: ${env:GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Using GitHub auth in app code [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#using-github-auth-in-app-code)

Use the GitHub auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the GitHub API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the GitHub API:

PythonJavaScript

```nextra-code
import requests
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

"""
In this example, we will use Arcade to authenticate with GitHub and retrieve
the number of stargazers of the ArcadeAI/arcade-ai repository.

There is a tool for that in the Arcade SDK, which simplifies the process for
you to interact with GitHub either through our Python or JavaScript SDKs or via
LLM tool calling.

Below we are just showing how to use Arcade as an auth provider, if you ever
need to.
"""

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="github",
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

if not auth_response.context.token:
    raise ValueError("No token found in auth response")

token = auth_response.context.token

owner = "ArcadeAI"
name = "arcade-ai"
headers = {
    "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
    "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
}
url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{name}"

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
response.raise_for_status()

print(response.json().get("stargazers_count"))
```

```nextra-code
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "user@example.com";

/*
In this example, we will use Arcade to authenticate with GitHub and retrieve

There is a tool for that in the Arcade SDK, which simplifies the process for
you to interact with GitHub either through our Python or JavaScript SDKs or via
LLM tool calling.

Below we are just showing how to use Arcade as an auth provider, if you ever
need to.
*/

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "github");

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

if (!authResponse.context.token) {
  throw new Error("No token found in auth response");
}

const token = authResponse.context.token;

const owner = "ArcadeAI";
const name = "arcade-ai";
const headers = {
  Accept: "application/vnd.github+json",
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
};
const url = `https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${name}`;

const response = await fetch(url, { headers });
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
}
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.stargazers_count);
```

## Using GitHub auth in custom tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/github\#using-github-auth-in-custom-tools)

You can use the pre-built [Arcade GitHub toolkit](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/development/github/github) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with GitHub.

If the pre-built tools in the GitHub toolkit don’t meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the GitHub API.

Use the `GitHub()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with GitHub. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s GitHub token:

```nextra-code
from typing import Annotated

import httpx
from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import GitHub


@tool(requires_auth=GitHub())
async def count_stargazers(
    context: ToolContext,
    owner: Annotated[str, "The owner of the repository"],
    name: Annotated[str, "The name of the repository"],
) -> Annotated[int, "The number of stargazers (stars) for the specified repository"]:
    """Count the number of stargazers (stars) for a GitHub repository."""
    if not context.authorization or not context.authorization.token:
        raise ValueError("No token found in context")

    headers = {
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
        "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
    }
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{name}"

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json().get("stargazers_count", 0)
```

## Auth [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/toolkits/social-communication/linkedin\#auth)

The Arcade LinkedIn toolkit uses the [LinkedIn auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin) to connect to users’ LinkedIn accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there’s nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that’s requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the LinkedIn auth provider](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/auth-providers/linkedin#configuring-linkedin-auth) with your own LinkedIn app credentials.
