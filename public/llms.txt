# Arcade

> Arcade is an AI Tool-calling Platform. For the first time, AI can securely act on behalf of users through Arcade's authenticated integrations, or "tools" in AI lingo. Connect AI to email, files, calendars, and APIs to build assistants that don't just chat - they get work done. Start building in minutes with our pre-built connectors or custom SDK.

Arcade enables your AI agent to securely take real-world actions through user-specific permissions, pre-built MCP Servers for Gmail, Slack, GitHub, and more. You can also build your own agentic tools and MCP servers with our authoring and testing suite. Arcade is your tool engine, registry, and runtime.
