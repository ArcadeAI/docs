Contextual Access Webhook API

# API Reference

This is the interactive documentation for the **Contextual Access webhook contract** — the HTTP interface your server implements to integrate with Arcade.

Endpoint paths shown below (`/pre`, `/post`, `/access`, `/health`) are defaults. You specify the actual paths when configuring your extension in the Dashboard. The request and response payloads remain the same regardless of path.

The OpenAPI 3.0 spec is also available to download for code generation:

-   **GitHub:** [logic\_extensions/http/1.0/schema.yaml](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/schemas/blob/main/logic_extensions/http/1.0/schema.yaml)
