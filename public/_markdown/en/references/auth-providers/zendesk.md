# Zendesk

Arcade does not offer a default Zendesk . To use Zendesk auth, you must create a [custom provider configuration](/references/auth-providers/oauth2.md) as described below.

The Zendesk  enables tools and  to call Zendesk APIs on behalf of a .

## What’s documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Zendesk auth with Arcade.

This  is used by:

-   The [Arcade Zendesk MCP Server](/resources/integrations/customer-support/zendesk.md)
    , which provides pre-built  for interacting with Zendesk services
-   Your [app code](#using-zendesk-auth-in-app-code)
     that needs to call Zendesk APIs
-   Or, your [custom tools](#using-zendesk-auth-in-custom-tools)
     that need to call Zendesk APIs

## Create a Zendesk app

When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your  to use a [custom user verifier](/guides/user-facing-agents/secure-auth-production.md#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or  in production.

### Additional guides

The following three guides from Zendesk will be helpful additional information as you progress through this guide:

1.  [Using OAuth authentication with your application](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408845965210-Using-OAuth-authentication-with-your-application)
     
2.  [Set up a global OAuth client](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/marketplace/building-a-marketplace-app/set-up-a-global-oauth-client/)
     
3.  [Getting a trial or sponsored account for development](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/api-basics/getting-started/getting-a-trial-or-sponsored-account-for-development/)
     

### Creating a Zendesk app for Arcade

1.  Create your Organization in the [Zendesk Marketplace portal](https://apps.zendesk.com/)
     .
2.  Create a Zendesk support  at [https://www.zendesk.com/login](https://www.zendesk.com/login)
      . If you need a global OAuth client, then the subdomain MUST begin with “d3v-”. You will need a global OAuth client if your app will use  for multiple customers with their own Zendesk instances (multiple subdomains).
3.  In [the Admin Center](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4581766374554#topic_hfg_dyz_1hb)
     , click “Apps and integrations” in the sidebar, then select APIs > OAuth clients > Add OAuth client.
    -   Ensure your identifier is prefixed with “zdg-” if you will need a global OAuth client.
    -   Select “Public” for “Client kind”.
    -   Use the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below) as your “Redirect URL”.
4.  Copy and store your identifier for later. This will be your **Client ID**.
5.  Copy and store your generated secret for later. This will be your **Client Secret**.
6.  (Only for Global OAuth client) Request a global OAuth client.
    -   First, you will need to request a sponsored  and wait for approval from Zendesk. You can request a sponsored account [here](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/api-basics/getting-started/getting-a-trial-or-sponsored-account-for-development/#requesting-a-sponsored-test-account)
         .
    -   When filling out the sponsored  request form, ensure you select “App Developer / ISV” as your Developer Type.
    -   After you have a sponsored , sign into the [Zendesk Marketplace portal](https://apps.zendesk.com/)
         
    -   Organization > Global OAuth Request and fill out the form. Zendesk will typically review your request within 1 week.

## Get your Zendesk subdomain

Your Zendesk subdomain is the value before the `.zendesk.com` part. For example, if your Zendesk domain is `https://d3v-acme-inc.zendesk.com`, your Zendesk subdomain is `d3v-acme-inc`. Take note of your Zendesk subdomain. You will need this value in the next steps.

## Set the Zendesk Subdomain Secret

Set the `ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN` secret in the [Arcade Dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/secrets) .

## Configuring Zendesk Auth

### Dashboard GUI

### Configure Zendesk Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

Navigate to the [Arcade Dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/oauth)  OAuth Providers page.

#### Navigate to the Add Custom Provider page

-   Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
-   Click the **Custom Provider** tab at the top.

#### Enter the provider details

-   ID: `zendesk`
-   Description: `<your description>`
-   Client ID: `<your identifier>` (This is prefixed with `zdg-` if you are using a global OAuth client)
-   Client Secret: `<your client secret>`
-   Authorization Endpoint: `https://<your-zendesk-subdomain>.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new`
-   Token Endpoint: `https://<your-zendesk-subdomain>.zendesk.com/oauth/tokens`
-   PKCE Settings:
    -   Enable PKCE: `enabled`
    -   PKCE Method: `S256` (Default)
-   Authorization Settings:
    -   Response Type: `code` (Default)
    -   Scope: `{{scopes}} {{existing_scopes}}` (Default)
-   Token Settings:
    -   Authentication Method: `Client Secret Basic` (Default)
    -   Response Content Type: `application/json` (Default)
-   Refresh Token Settings:
    -   Refresh Token Endpoint: `https://<your-zendesk-subdomain>.zendesk.com/oauth/tokens`
    -   Authentication Method: `Client Secret Basic` (Default)
    -   Response Content Type: `application/json`
-   Token Introspection Settings:
    -   Enable Token Introspection: `disabled` (Default)

Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Zendesk app’s redirect URL.

## Using Zendesk auth in app code

Use the Zendesk  you just created in your own  and AI apps to get a  token for Zendesk APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/get-started/about-arcade.md) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a  token for Zendesk APIs:

### Python

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id="{arcade_user_id}",
    provider="zendesk",
    scopes=["read_account"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token

# Do something interesting with the token...
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, {
  provider: "zendesk",
  scopes: ["read_account"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;

// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Zendesk auth in custom tools

If the [Arcade Zendesk MCP Server](/resources/integrations/customer-support/zendesk.md) does not meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/build-mcp-server.md) that interact with Zendesk APIs.

Use the `OAuth2()` auth class to specify that a  requires authorization with Zendesk. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the ’s Zendesk token:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Any

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import OAuth2

import httpx


@tool(
  requires_auth=OAuth2(id="zendesk", scopes=["read"]),
  requires_secrets=["ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN"],
)
async def get_tickets(
  context: ToolContext
) -> Annotated[dict[str, Any], "Recent tickets from Zendesk"]:
    """Get recent tickets from Zendesk including basic ticket information"""
    token = context.get_auth_token_or_empty()
    subdomain = context.get_secret("ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN")
    url = f"https://{subdomain}.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets.json"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/json",
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        resp = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        resp.raise_for_status()
        data = resp.json()

        return {"tickets": data}
```
