# Twitch

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Twitch . To use Twitch auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Twitch OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Twitch  enables tools and  to call the Twitch API on behalf of a .

### What’s documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Twitch auth with Arcade.

This  is used by:

-   Your [app code](#using-twitch-auth-in-app-code)
     that needs to call Twitch APIs
-   Or, your [custom tools](#using-twitch-auth-in-custom-tools)
     that need to call Twitch APIs

## Configuring Twitch auth

When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your  to use a [custom user verifier](/guides/user-facing-agents/secure-auth-production.md#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or  in production.

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Twitch app credentials. This way, your  will see your application’s name requesting permission.

Before showing how to configure your Twitch app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Twitch app.

### Create a Twitch app

-   Twitch requires that you have two-factor authentication enabled for your . Enable in your [account security seetings](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security)
     
-   Create a Twitch Application in the [Twitch App Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
     
-   Set the OAuth Redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
-   Select your Application category
-   Select the ‘Confidential’ Client Type
-   Copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you’ll need below

Next, add the Twitch app to Arcade.

## Configuring your own Twitch Auth Provider in Arcade

### Dashboard GUI

### Configure Twitch Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard) . If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:9099/dashboard](http://localhost:9099/dashboard) . Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

-   Under the **Connections** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Connected Apps**.
-   Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
-   Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
-   In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Twitch**.

#### Enter the provider details

-   Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-twitch-provider”).
-   Optionally enter a **Description**.
-   Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Twitch app.
-   Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Twitch app’s OAuth Redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used.

When you use tools that require Twitch auth using your Arcade  credentials, Arcade will automatically use this Twitch OAuth provider. If you have multiple Twitch providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/references/auth-providers.md#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Twitch auth in app code

Use the Twitch  in your own  and AI apps to get a \-scoped token for the Twitch API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/get-started/about-arcade.md) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a  token for the Twitch API:

### Python

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="twitch",
    scopes=["channel:manage:polls"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "twitch", {
  scopes: ["channel:manage:polls"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Twitch auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/build-mcp-server.md) that interact with the Twitch API.

Use the `Twitch()` auth class to specify that a  requires authorization with Twitch. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the ’s Twitch token:

```json
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Twitch


@tool(
    requires_auth=Twitch(
        scopes=["channel:manage:polls"],
    )
)
async def create_poll(
    context: ToolContext,
    broadcaster_id: Annotated[
        str,
        "The ID of the broadcaster to create the poll for.",
    ],
    title: Annotated[
        str,
        "The title of the poll.",
    ],
    choices: Annotated[
        list[str],
        "The choices of the poll.",
    ],
    duration: Annotated[
        int,
        "The duration of the poll in seconds.",
    ],
) -> Annotated[dict, "The poll that was created"]:
    """Create a poll for a Twitch channel."""
    url = "https://api.twitch.tv/helix/polls"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
        "Client-Id": "your_client_id",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    payload = {
        "broadcaster_id": broadcaster_id,
        "title": title,
        "choices": [{"title": choice} for choice in choices],
        "duration": duration,
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
