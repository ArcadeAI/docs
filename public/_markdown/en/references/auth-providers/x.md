# X

The X  enables tools and  to call the X (Twitter) API on behalf of a .

Want to quickly get started with X services in your  or AI app? The pre-built [Arcade X MCP Server](/resources/integrations/social/x.md) is what you want!

### What’s documented here

This page describes how to use and configure X auth with Arcade.

This  is used by:

-   The [Arcade X MCP Server](/resources/integrations/social/x.md)
    , which provides pre-built  for interacting with X
-   Your [app code](#using-x-auth-in-app-code)
     that needs to call X APIs
-   Or, your [custom tools](#using-x-auth-in-custom-tools)
     that need to call X APIs

## Configuring X auth

When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your  to use a [custom user verifier](/guides/user-facing-agents/secure-auth-production.md#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or  in production.

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own X app credentials. This way, your  will see your application’s name requesting permission.

Before showing how to configure your X app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a X app.

### Create an X app

-   Follow X’s guide to [creating an app](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-x-api)
     
-   Enable  authentication for your new app, and set its type to “Web App, Automated App or Bot”
-   Set the redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
-   Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the X app to Arcade.

## Configuring your own X Auth Provider in Arcade

### Dashboard GUI

### Configure X Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard) . If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:9099/dashboard](http://localhost:9099/dashboard) . Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

-   Under the **Connections** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Connected Apps**.
-   Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
-   Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
-   In the **Provider** dropdown, select **X**.

#### Enter the provider details

-   Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-x-provider”).
-   Optionally enter a **Description**.
-   Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your X app.
-   Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your X app’s redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used.

When you use tools that require X auth using your Arcade  credentials, Arcade will automatically use this X OAuth provider. If you have multiple X providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/references/auth-providers.md#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using X auth in app code

Use the X  in your own  and AI apps to get a  token for the X API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/get-started/about-arcade.md) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a  token for X:

### Python

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="x",
    scopes=["tweet.read", "tweet.write", "users.read"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "x", [
  "tweet.read",
  "tweet.write",
  "users.read",
]);

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using X auth in custom tools

You can use the pre-built [Arcade X MCP Server](/resources/integrations/social/x.md) to quickly build  and AI apps that interact with X.

If the pre-built tools in the X  Server don’t meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/build-mcp-server.md) that interact with the X API.

Use the `X()` auth class to specify that a  requires authorization with X. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the ’s X token:

```json
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import X


@tool(
    requires_auth=X(
        scopes=["tweet.read", "tweet.write", "users.read"],
    )
)
async def post_tweet(
    context: ToolContext,
    tweet_text: Annotated[str, "The text content of the tweet you want to post"],
) -> Annotated[str, "Success string and the URL of the tweet"]:
    """Post a tweet to X (Twitter)."""
    url = "https://api.x.com/2/tweets"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    payload = {"text": tweet_text}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()

        tweet_id = response.json()["data"]["id"]
        return f"Tweet with id {tweet_id} posted successfully. URL: https://x.com/x/status/{tweet_id}"
```
