# Dropbox

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Dropbox . To use Dropbox auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Dropbox OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Dropbox  enables tools and  to call the Dropbox API on behalf of a .

### What’s documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Dropbox auth with Arcade.

This  is used by:

-   Your [app code](#using-dropbox-auth-in-app-code)
     that needs to call Dropbox APIs
-   Or, your [custom tools](#using-dropbox-auth-in-custom-tools)
     that need to call Dropbox APIs

## Configuring Dropbox auth

When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your  to use a [custom user verifier](/guides/user-facing-agents/secure-auth-production.md#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or  in production.

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Dropbox app credentials. This way, your  will see your application’s name requesting permission.

Before showing how to configure your Dropbox app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Dropbox app.

### Create a Dropbox app

-   Create a Dropbox Application in the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
     
-   In the Settings tab, under the “OAuth 2” section, set the redirect URI to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
-   In the Permissions tab, add any scopes that your app will need
-   In the Settings tab, copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you’ll need below

Next, add the Dropbox app to Arcade.

## Configuring your own Dropbox Auth Provider in Arcade

### Dashboard GUI

### Configure Dropbox Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard) . If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:9099/dashboard](http://localhost:9099/dashboard) . Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

-   Under the **Connections** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Connected Apps**.
-   Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
-   Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
-   In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Dropbox**.

#### Enter the provider details

-   Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-dropbox-provider”).
-   Optionally enter a **Description**.
-   Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Dropbox app.
-   Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be added to your Dropbox app’s Redirect URIs.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used.

When you use tools that require Dropbox auth using your Arcade  credentials, Arcade will automatically use this Dropbox OAuth provider. If you have multiple Dropbox providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/references/auth-providers.md#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Dropbox auth in app code

Use the Dropbox  in your own  and AI apps to get a \-scoped token for the Dropbox API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/get-started/about-arcade.md) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a  token for the Dropbox API:

### Python

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="dropbox",
    scopes=["openid", "sharing.read", "files.metadata.read"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "dropbox", {
  scopes: ["openid", "sharing.read", "files.metadata.read"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Dropbox auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/build-mcp-server.md) that interact with the Dropbox API.

Use the `Dropbox()` auth class to specify that a  requires authorization with Dropbox. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the ’s Dropbox token:

```json
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Dropbox


@tool(
    requires_auth=Dropbox(
        scopes=["files.metadata.read"],
    )
)
async def list_files(
    context: ToolContext,
    path: Annotated[
        Optional[str],
        "The path to the folder to list the contents of. Defaults to empty string to list the root folder.",
    ] = "",
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of servers the user is a member of"]:
    """Starts returning the contents of a folder."""
    url = "https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/files/list_folder"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json={"path": path})
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
