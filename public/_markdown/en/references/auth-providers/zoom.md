# Zoom

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Zoom . To use Zoom auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Zoom OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Zoom  enables tools and  to call the Zoom API on behalf of a .

### What’s documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Zoom auth with Arcade.

This  is used by:

-   Your [app code](#using-zoom-auth-in-app-code)
     that needs to call Zoom APIs
-   Or, your [custom tools](#using-zoom-auth-in-custom-tools)
     that need to call Zoom APIs

## Configuring Zoom auth

When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your  to use a [custom user verifier](/guides/user-facing-agents/secure-auth-production.md#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or  in production.

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Zoom app credentials. This way, your  will see your application’s name requesting permission.

Before showing how to configure your Zoom app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Zoom app.

### Create a Zoom app

-   Follow Zoom’s guide to [registering an app](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/create/)
      on the Zoom marketplace
-   Set the redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below) and enable Strict Mode
-   Enable the Zoom features and permissions (scopes) that your app needs
-   Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Zoom app to Arcade.

## Configuring your own Zoom Auth Provider in Arcade

### Dashboard GUI

### Configure Zoom Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard) . If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:9099/dashboard](http://localhost:9099/dashboard) . Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

-   Under the **Connections** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Connected Apps**.
-   Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
-   Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
-   In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Zoom**.

#### Enter the provider details

-   Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-zoom-provider”).
-   Optionally enter a **Description**.
-   Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Zoom app.
-   Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Zoom app’s redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used.

When you use tools that require Zoom auth using your Arcade  credentials, Arcade will automatically use this Zoom OAuth provider. If you have multiple Zoom providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/references/auth-providers.md#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Zoom auth in app code

Use the Zoom  in your own  and AI apps to get a  token for the Zoom API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/get-started/about-arcade.md) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a  token for the Zoom API:

### Python

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="zoom",
    scopes=["meeting:read:list_upcoming_meetings"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade(); // Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "zoom", [
  "meeting:read:list_upcoming_meetings",
]);

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Zoom auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/build-mcp-server.md) that interact with the Zoom API.

Use the `Zoom()` auth class to specify that a  requires authorization with Zoom. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the ’s Zoom token:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Zoom


@tool(
    requires_auth=Zoom(
        scopes=["meeting:read:list_upcoming_meetings"],
    )
)
async def list_upcoming_meetings(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_id: Annotated[
        Optional[str],
        "The user's user ID or email address. Defaults to 'me' for the current user.",
    ] = "me",
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of upcoming meetings within the next 24 hours"]:
    """List a Zoom user's upcoming meetings within the next 24 hours."""
    url = f"https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/{user_id}/upcoming_meetings"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
