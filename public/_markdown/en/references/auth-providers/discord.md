# Discord

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Discord . To use Discord auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Discord OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Discord  enables tools and  to call the Discord API on behalf of a .

### What’s documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Discord auth with Arcade.

This  is used by:

-   Your [app code](#using-discord-auth-in-app-code)
     that needs to call Discord APIs
-   Or, your [custom tools](#using-discord-auth-in-custom-tools)
     that need to call Discord APIs

## Configuring Discord auth

When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your  to use a [custom user verifier](/guides/user-facing-agents/secure-auth-production.md#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or  in production.

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Discord app credentials. This way, your  will see your application’s name requesting permission.

Before showing how to configure your Discord app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Discord app.

### Create a Discord app

-   Create a Discord Application in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
     
-   In the OAuth2 tab, set the redirect URI to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
-   Copy the Client ID and Client Secret (you may need to reset the secret to see it)

## Configuring your own Discord Auth Provider in Arcade

### Dashboard GUI

### Configure Discord Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard) . If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:9099/dashboard](http://localhost:9099/dashboard) . Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

-   Under the **Connections** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Connected Apps**.
-   Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
-   Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
-   In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Discord**.

#### Enter the provider details

-   Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-discord-provider”).
-   Optionally enter a **Description**.
-   Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Discord app.
-   Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be added to your Discord app’s Redirect URIs.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used.

When you use tools that require Discord auth using your Arcade  credentials, Arcade will automatically use this Discord OAuth provider. If you have multiple Discord providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/references/auth-providers.md#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Discord auth in app code

Use the Discord  in your own  and AI apps to get a  token for the Discord API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/get-started/about-arcade.md) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a  token for the Discord API:

### Python

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="discord",
    scopes=["identify", "email", "guilds", "guilds.join"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "discord", {
  scopes: ["identify", "email", "guilds", "guilds.join"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Discord auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/build-mcp-server.md) that interact with the Discord API.

Use the `Discord()` auth class to specify that a  requires authorization with Discord. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the ’s Discord token:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Discord


@tool(
    requires_auth=Discord(
        scopes=["guilds"],
    )
)
async def list_servers(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_id: Annotated[
        Optional[str],
        "The user's user ID. Defaults to '@me' for the current user.",
    ] = "@me",
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of servers the user is a member of"]:
    """List a Discord user's servers they are a member of."""
    url = f"https://discord.com/api/users/{user_id}/guilds"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
