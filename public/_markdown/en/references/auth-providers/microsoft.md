# Microsoft

At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Microsoft . To use Microsoft auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Microsoft OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.

The Microsoft  enables tools and  to call the Microsoft Graph API on behalf of a .

### What’s documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Microsoft auth with Arcade.

This  is used by:

-   Your [app code](#using-microsoft-auth-in-app-code)
     that needs to call Microsoft Graph APIs
-   Or, your [custom tools](#using-microsoft-auth-in-custom-tools)
     that need to call Microsoft Graph APIs

## Configuring Microsoft auth

When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your  to use a [custom user verifier](/guides/user-facing-agents/secure-auth-production.md#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or  in production.

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Microsoft app credentials. This way, your  will see your application’s name requesting permission.

Before showing how to configure your Microsoft app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Microsoft app.

### Create a Microsoft app

-   Follow Microsoft’s guide to [registering an app with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app)
     
-   Choose the permissions (scopes) you need for your app. Refer to the \[section below\](#arcade-microsoft- Servers-scopes) for a list of scopes needed by the Arcade Microsoft , in case you intend to use them.
-   Set the redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
-   Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Microsoft app to Arcade.

## Configuring your own Microsoft Auth Provider in Arcade

### Dashboard GUI

### Configure Microsoft Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard) . If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:9099/dashboard](http://localhost:9099/dashboard) . Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

-   Under the **Connections** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Connected Apps**.
-   Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
-   Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
-   In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Microsoft**.

#### Enter the provider details

-   Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-microsoft-provider”).
-   Optionally enter a **Description**.
-   Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Microsoft app.
-   Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Microsoft app’s redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used.

When you use tools that require Microsoft auth using your Arcade  credentials, Arcade will automatically use this Microsoft OAuth provider. If you have multiple Microsoft providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/references/auth-providers.md#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Microsoft auth in app code

Use the Microsoft  in your own  and AI apps to get a  token for Microsoft Graph APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/get-started/about-arcade.md) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a  token for Microsoft Graph APIs:

### Python

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="microsoft",
    scopes=["User.Read", "Files.Read"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# TODO: Do something interesting with the token...
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
let authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "microsoft", {
  scopes: ["User.Read", "Files.Read"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// TODO: Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Microsoft auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/build-mcp-server.md) that interact with Microsoft Graph APIs.

Use the `Microsoft()` auth class to specify that a  requires authorization with Microsoft. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the ’s Microsoft token:

```python
from typing import Annotated

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Microsoft


@tool(
    requires_auth=Microsoft(
        scopes=["User.Read", "Files.Read"],
    )
)
async def get_file_contents(
    context: ToolContext,
    file_id: Annotated[str, "The ID of the file to get the contents of"],
) -> Annotated[str, "The contents of the file"]:
    """Get the contents of a file from Microsoft Graph."""
    url = f"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/items/{file_id}"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(
            url=url,
            headers=headers,
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
