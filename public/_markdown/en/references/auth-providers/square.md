Square

# Square

The Square  enables tools and  to call [Square APIs](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square)  on behalf of a  using OAuth 2.0 authentication.

Want to quickly get started with Square in your  or AI app? The pre-built [Arcade Square MCP Server](/resources/integrations/productivity/squareupapi.md) is what you want!

### What’s documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Square auth with Arcade.

This  is used by:

-   The [Arcade Square MCP Server](/resources/integrations/productivity/squareupapi.md)
    , which provides pre-built  for interacting with Square
-   Your [app code](#using-square-auth-in-app-code)
     that needs to call the Square API
-   Or, your [custom tools](#using-square-auth-in-custom-tools)
     that need to call the Square API

## Configuring Square auth

When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your  to use a [custom user verifier](/guides/user-facing-agents/secure-auth-production.md#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or  in production.

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Square app credentials. This way, your  will see your application’s name requesting permission.

Before showing how to configure your Square app credentials, let’s go through the steps to create a Square app.

### Create a Square app

To integrate with Square’s API, you’ll need to create an application in the Square Developer Dashboard:

#### Access the Square Developer Dashboard

Navigate to the [Square Developer Portal](https://developer.squareup.com/)  and sign in with your Square  or create a new one.

#### Create a new application

1.  Once logged in, go to the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/apps)
     
2.  Click on “Create App” or ”+” button
3.  Fill in the required details:
    -   **App Name**: Choose a descriptive name for your application
    -   **Description**: Provide a brief description of your app’s purpose

#### Configure OAuth settings

1.  After creating your app, navigate to the **OAuth** tab
2.  Set the **Redirect URL** to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see configuration section below)
3.  Configure the required **Permissions** (scopes) for your application:
    -   `MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ` - Read merchant profile information
    -   `PAYMENTS_READ` - Read payment information
    -   `PAYMENTS_WRITE` - Process payments
    -   Add other scopes as needed for your use case

#### Obtain your credentials

1.  In your app’s dashboard, go to the **Credentials** tab
2.  You’ll find your **Application ID** (Client ID) and **Application Secret** (Client Secret)
3.  Copy both values for use in Arcade configuration

For detailed instructions, refer to Square’s [OAuth documentation](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/overview) .

Next, add the Square app to Arcade.

## Configuring your own Square Auth Provider in Arcade

### Dashboard GUI

### Configure Square Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard) . If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:9099/dashboard](http://localhost:9099/dashboard) . Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

-   Under the **Connections** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Connected Apps**.
-   Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
-   Select the **OAuth 2.0** tab at the top.

#### Enter the provider details

-   Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “arcade-square”).
-   Optionally enter a **Description**.
-   Enter the **Client ID** (Application ID) and **Client Secret** (Application Secret) from your Square app.
-   Configure the OAuth 2.0 endpoints:
    -   **Authorization URL**: `https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/authorize`
    -   **Token URL**: `https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/token`
-   Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Square app’s Redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used.

### Configuration File

### Configure Square Auth Using Configuration File

This method is only available when you are \[self-hosting the engine\](/guides/deployment-hosting/on-prem

#### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SQUARE_CLIENT_ID="<your application ID>"
export SQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your application secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
SQUARE_CLIENT_ID="<your application ID>"
SQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your application secret>"
```

#### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a new item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml
auth:
  providers:
    - id: arcade-square
      description: Square OAuth 2.0 provider
      enabled: true
      type: oauth2
      client_id: ${env:SQUARE_CLIENT_ID}
      client_secret: ${env:SQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET}
      oauth2:
        scope_delimiter: " "
        authorize_request:
          endpoint: "https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/authorize"
          params:
            response_type: code
            client_id: "{{client_id}}"
            redirect_uri: "{{redirect_uri}}"
            scope: "{{scopes}}"
            state: "{{state}}"
        token_request:
          endpoint: "https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/token"
          params:
            grant_type: authorization_code
            client_id: "{{client_id}}"
            client_secret: "{{client_secret}}"
            redirect_uri: "{{redirect_uri}}"
          response_content_type: application/json
```

When you use tools that require Square auth using your Arcade  credentials, Arcade will automatically use this Square OAuth provider. If you have multiple Square providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/references/auth-providers.md#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

## Using Square auth in app code

Use the Square  in your own  and AI apps to get a  token for the Square API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/get-started/about-arcade.md) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a  token for the Square API:

### Python

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="arcade-square",
    scopes=["MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ", "PAYMENTS_READ"]
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "arcade-square", [
  "MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ",
  "PAYMENTS_READ",
]);

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Square auth in custom tools

You can use the pre-built [Arcade Square MCP Server](/resources/integrations/productivity/squareupapi.md) to quickly build  and AI apps that interact with Square.

If the pre-built tools in the Square  Server don’t meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/build-mcp-server.md) that interact with the Square API.

Use the `OAuth2()` auth class to specify that a  requires authorization with Square. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the ’s Square token:

```python
from typing import Annotated

import httpx
from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import OAuth2


@tool(
    requires_auth=OAuth2(
        provider_id="arcade-square",
        scopes=["MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ"]
    )
)
async def get_merchant_info(
    context: ToolContext,
) -> Annotated[dict, "The merchant information."]:
    """
    Retrieve merchant profile information from Square.
    """
    url = "https://connect.squareup.com/v2/merchants/me"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": context.authorization.token,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return dict(response.json())
```

## Available Scopes

Square supports various OAuth scopes that determine the level of access your application has:

-   `MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ` - Read merchant profile information
-   `PAYMENTS_READ` - Read payment information
-   `PAYMENTS_WRITE` - Process payments
-   `CUSTOMERS_READ` - Read customer information
-   `CUSTOMERS_WRITE` - Create and update customers
-   `ORDERS_READ` - Read order information
-   `ORDERS_WRITE` - Create and update orders
-   `INVENTORY_READ` - Read inventory information
-   `INVENTORY_WRITE` - Update inventory

For a complete list of available scopes, refer to the [Square OAuth Permissions documentation](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/square-permissions) .
