Version 2.0.0 of the  was released this week. Upgrading to version 2.0.0 is recommended for all self-hosted developers, and includes an important security fix for [secure OAuth flows](/guides/user-facing-agents/secure-auth-production.md). After upgrading, all  will default to using the Arcade user verifier. If desired, you can then implement a custom user verifier in your application/ and make the switch via the Arcade Dashboard.

Self-hosed Arcade developers cannot be grandfathered into the old (insecure) behavior of skipping  verification once the Engine is upgraded to version 2.0.0 or higher.
