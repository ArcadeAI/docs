# Discord

The Discord auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Discord API on behalf of a user.

### What’s documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Discord auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

-   Your [app code](#using-discord-auth-in-app-code)
     that needs to call Discord APIs
-   Or, your [custom tools](#using-discord-auth-in-custom-tools)
     that need to call Discord APIs

## Configuring Discord auth

### Create a Discord app

-   Create a Discord Application in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
     
-   In the OAuth2 tab, set the redirect URI to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
-   Copy the Client ID and Client Secret (you may need to reset the secret to see it)

Next, add the Discord app to Arcade.

### Configuring Discord auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1.  Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2.  Select **Discord** as the provider.
3.  Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. “my-discord-provider”) with an optional **Description**.
4.  Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Discord app.
5.  Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Discord app’s redirect URL.
6.  Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Discord auth using your Arcade account credentials, Arcade will automatically use this Discord OAuth provider.

## Using Discord auth in app code

Use the Discord auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Discord API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/get-started/about-arcade.md) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Discord API:

### Python

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "{arcade_user_id}"

# Start the authorization process
auth_response = client.auth.start(
    user_id=user_id,
    provider="discord",
    scopes=["identify", "email", "guilds", "guilds.join"],
)

if auth_response.status != "completed":
    print("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:")
    print(auth_response.url)

# Wait for the authorization to complete
auth_response = client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_response)

token = auth_response.context.token
# Do something interesting with the token...
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const userId = "{arcade_user_id}";

// Start the authorization process
const authResponse = await client.auth.start(userId, "discord", {
  scopes: ["identify", "email", "guilds", "guilds.join"],
});

if (authResponse.status !== "completed") {
  console.log("Please complete the authorization challenge in your browser:");
  console.log(authResponse.url);
}

// Wait for the authorization to complete
authResponse = await client.auth.waitForCompletion(authResponse);

const token = authResponse.context.token;
// Do something interesting with the token...
```

## Using Discord auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/build-mcp-server.md) that interact with the Discord API.

Use the `Discord()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Discord. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user’s Discord token:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Optional

import httpx

from arcade_tdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade_tdk.auth import Discord


@tool(
    requires_auth=Discord(
        scopes=["guilds"],
    )
)
async def list_servers(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_id: Annotated[
        Optional[str],
        "The user's user ID. Defaults to '@me' for the current user.",
    ] = "@me",
) -> Annotated[dict, "List of servers the user is a member of"]:
    """List a Discord user's servers they are a member of."""
    url = f"https://discord.com/api/users/{user_id}/guilds"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```
