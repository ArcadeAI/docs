Arcade Registry Early Access

# The Arcade Registry

The **Arcade Registry** is how agentic tool developers share their work with the world. Arcade.dev is collecting all the integrations that  will ever need in one place - think HuggingFace or Pypi but for LLM . A powerful community of open source and for-profit developers building out robust and evaluated workflows is how agents can be elevated to being _truly_ useful.

**_The components of the Arcade Registry_** ![The Arcade Registry diagram](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fregistry.d8b58aa5.png&w=3840&q=75)

Unlike traditional read-only  libraries, Arcade.dev couples the runtime with the registry. This way we can collect real metrics and usage information about your tools, sharing meaningful information and feedback back to the developers. You’ll get error reports and statistics about how your tools are getting used. Arcade.dev also makes it possible for developers to optionally choose to sell their tools with a markup on top of the Arcade platform fees.

Thanks to the Arcade Engine, your  Servers will be available via all the protocols Arcade supports - be that MCP for locally-running applications, OXP for server applications, and whatever comes next. Use the open-source Arcade SDKs to future-proof your .

We are seeking beta testers who are interested in building, maintaining, and sharing  Servers with the world in either a free-to-use or for-profit manner. Sign up today to join the Arcade Registry Beta.
