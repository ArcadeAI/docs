Learn how to [configure secrets](/guides/create-tools/tool-basics/create-tool-secrets).\n\n### Getting your Zoho Server URL\n\nThe Zoho Server URL is the base URL for your Zoho account's data center. Zoho operates in multiple data centers around the world, and you must use the correct URL for your account.\n\nYour Zoho Server URL depends on which data center your account is registered in:\n\n| Data Center | Server URL                  |\n| ----------- | --------------------------- |\n| US          | `https://books.zoho.com`    |\n| EU          | `https://books.zoho.eu`     |\n| India       | `https://books.zoho.in`     |\n| Australia   | `https://books.zoho.com.au` |\n| China       | `https://books.zoho.com.cn` |\n\nTo determine which data center your account uses:\n\n1. Log in to your Zoho Books account\n2. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar\n3. The domain (`.com`, `.eu`, `.in`, `.com.au`, or `.com.cn`) indicates your data center\n\nFor example, if you access Zoho Books at `https://books.zoho.eu`, your server URL is `https://books.zoho.eu`.\n\nThe server URL is used as the base for all API requests. For example, when retrieving invoices, the full URL would be constructed as:\n\n```\n{zoho_server_url}/api/v3/invoices?organization_id=...\n```\n\nWhich would become `https://books.zoho.com/api/v3/invoices?organization_id=...` for US accounts.",
