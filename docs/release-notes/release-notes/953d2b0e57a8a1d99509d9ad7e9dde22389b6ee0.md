# Release: Support Engine Identity for Key Routes

As of July 30, 2025, this release adds Engine identity handling across authentication flows and hardens related configurations.

### New Features
- Validate Engine identity via JWTs (EC256 public keys and JWS) for designated routes
- Update permission-check endpoints to accept and verify Engine credentials
- Enhance OAuth startup flows to accept Engine credentials alongside user tokens
- Enforce Content-Digest header validation for Engine-signed requests

### Bug Fixes
- Initialize three new public key configuration parameters with default values to prevent uninitialized-variable errors
