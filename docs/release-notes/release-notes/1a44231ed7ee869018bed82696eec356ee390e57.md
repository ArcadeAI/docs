# Release: Deprecate RSA Keys in Favor of ECDSA

As of August 4, 2025, this release deprecates RSA private keys and fully transitions to elliptic curve (ECDSA) cryptography, while adding robust support for multi-line configuration values.

### ðŸ”º Breaking Changes

- RSA private keys are deprecated across all components.  Existing configurations using RSA keys for JWT signing or JWKS generation will no longer work. You must replace RSA keys with ECDSA keys (e.g., P-256, P-384) in your configuration and environment variables.

### ðŸš€ New Features

- Introduced a custom `MultilineString` type to preserve newlines in multi-line environment variables and configuration files, ensuring correct parsing of PEM-encoded keys and other multiline content.
- Enhanced the configuration expander to correctly handle multi-line values for both file contents and environment variables, using a special token during parsing and restoring newlines during unmarshaling.
- Updated key parsing and JWK creation logic to use ECDSA keys for all cryptographic operations, replacing former RSA support for key management, JWT signing, and JWKS generation.
