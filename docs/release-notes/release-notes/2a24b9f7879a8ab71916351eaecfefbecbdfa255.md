# Apply Atlassian multi-cloud to the Confluence toolkit

**Release Date:** July 31, 2025

### 🚧 Breaking Changes
- Major version bump to **2.0.0** — ensure your integration points to the new release.
- All Confluence API scopes have changed from `read:space:confluence` to `read:page:confluence`. Cloud authorization checks now use the `/pages` endpoint instead of `/myself`.

### 🚀 New Features
- **Multi-cloud support:** Toolkit commands now accept an optional `atlassian_cloud_id` parameter and will automatically resolve the cloud ID based on stored credentials.
- **Cloud utilities:** Added functions to **list**, **resolve**, and **verify** available Atlassian Clouds.
- **New command:** `get_available_atlassian_clouds` fetches and displays all authorized cloud instances for your account.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed `get_available_atlassian_clouds` to correctly use the `read:page:confluence` scope during authorization checks and to return a `clouds` array in its response.
