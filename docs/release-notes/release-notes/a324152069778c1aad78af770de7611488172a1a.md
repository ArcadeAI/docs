# [ENG-1537][Jira Toolkit] Adding List Sprints ArcTool + List Boards ArcTool

Release Date: July 30, 2025

### New Features
- **List Boards ArcTool**: Retrieve Jira boards with pagination, identifier filtering, and deduplication by ID and name.
- **List Sprints ArcTool**: Fetch Jira sprints with pagination, optional date-range filtering, and sprint state filtering powered by the enhanced `SprintState` enum.
- **Enhanced SprintState Enum**: Supports new combination states and a `to_api_value` method that returns string lists for flexible API queries.
- **Multi-turn Pagination Support**: ArcTools now automatically handle sequential page retrieval for large result sets.
- **Cloud Resolution & URL Generation**: Resolve both Jira cloud ID and name, and include direct URLs for issues, projects, boards, and users in output.

### Improvements
- Standardized pagination keys: renamed `startAt` ➔ `current_offset` and `isLast` ➔ `is_last` in all outputs.
- Improved error handling and data validation when listing boards and sprints.

### Version Update
- Updated project version to **2.2.0**.
