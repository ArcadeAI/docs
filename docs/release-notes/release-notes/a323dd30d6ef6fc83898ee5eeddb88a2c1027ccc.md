Release Title: Add initial Engine identity code

As of July 31st, 2025

### Breaking Changes
- Configuration property renamed: `PrivateECDSAKeys` is now `PrivateKeys`. Please update your cloud configuration accordingly.

### New Features
- Introduce Engine identity management with ECDSA private key support: configure and parse PEM-encoded keys, generate JSON Web Signatures (JWS) for secure HTTP requests, and compute content digests for enhanced identity verification.
- Add `EngineSigner` to sign HTTP requests with JWS and Content-Digest headers, now integrated into cloud and OAuth flow coordinators for secure request authorization.
- Enable explicit engine disabling: omitting `engine_id` in cloud configuration logs a warning and returns a disabled signer (with `ErrEngineSignerDisabled`) to prevent request signing.

### Performance Improvements
- Optimize static file serving in `serveIndexFile` by adding ETag headers and supporting conditional GET (`If-None-Match`), improving client-side caching efficiency.
