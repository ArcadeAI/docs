# Release Notes (July 31, 2025)

## Breaking Changes
- Renamed package from `arcade_teams` to `arcade_microsoft_teams`; update all import paths accordingly.
- License changed to the proprietary Arcade Software License Agreement (commercial use only), replacing the MIT License.
- Python version requirement updated to â‰¥3.10 and <4.0 due to `microsoft-kiota-http` dependency constraints.

## New Features
- Added the Arcade Microsoft Teams Toolkit (`arcade-microsoft-teams`) to the supported toolkits list, enabling integration with Microsoft Teams.
- Introduced a comprehensive Microsoft Teams toolkit for managing channels, chats, messages, searches, users, and teams via the Microsoft Graph API.
- Added methods to retrieve and search channels, and to send and reply to messages in channels.
- Enabled full chat management: send messages, list chat threads, and retrieve chat metadata.
- Supported listing and searching users and team members, plus accessing team metadata.
- Included serializers for Teams objects, utility functions for consistent API request configuration, and dedicated error handling classes.

## Improvements
- Added input validation to `get_chat_metadata`, requiring at least one of `chat_id`, `user_ids`, or `user_names`, and preventing incompatible parameter combinations.
