## Welcome to Arcade AI?

Arcade AI is an integrations platform for language models. Arcade provides a unified API for language model providers that is capable of calling "tools"
handling end-user auth (like OAuth) separating client and server logic. By separating and managing tool execution, Arcade can support a diverse array of
compute environments for tools and scale independently from client applications.

Arcade AI allows you to focus on your core business logic while it handles the complexities of LLM operations.
