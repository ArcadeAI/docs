Adjust the playback position within the currently playing track.

Knowledge of the current playback state is NOT needed to use this tool as it handles clamping the position to valid start/end boundaries to prevent overshooting or negative values.

This tool allows you to seek to a specific position within the currently playing track. You can either provide an absolute position in milliseconds or a relative position from the current playback position in milliseconds.

Note: Either absolute_position_ms or relative_position_ms must be provided, but not both.

**Parameters**

- `absolute_position_ms` _(integer, optional)_ The absolute position in milliseconds to seek to

- `relative_position_ms` _(integer, optional)_ The relative position from the current playback position in milliseconds to seek to

Search Spotify catalog information

Explanation of the q parameter: You can narrow down your search using field filters. The available filters are album, artist, track, year, upc, tag:hipster, tag:new, isrc, and genre. Each field filter only applies to certain result types.

    The artist and year filters can be used while searching albums, artists and tracks. You can filter on a single year or a range (e.g. 1955-1960).
    The album filter can be used while searching albums and tracks.
    The genre filter can be used while searching artists and tracks.
    The isrc and track filters can be used while searching tracks.
    The upc, tag:new and tag:hipster filters can only be used while searching albums. The tag:new filter will return albums released in the past two weeks and tag:hipster can be used to return only albums with the lowest 10% popularity.

    Example: q="remaster track:Doxy artist:Miles Davis"

**Parameters**

- `q` _(string, required)_ The search query

- `types` _(array, required)_ The types of results to return, Valid values are 'album', 'artist', 'playlist', 'track', 'show', 'episode', 'audiobook'
