## Auth

The Arcade AI Drive toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](/integrations/auth/google) to connect to users' Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only, not
  for production use. To use Arcade AI and Google Drive in production, you must
  use a self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade AI, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](/integrations/auth/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.
