The Arcade AI Drive toolkit provides a pre-built set of tools for interacting with Google Drive. These tools make it easy to build agents and AI apps that can:

- List Google documents in the user's Google Drive

## Install

```bash
pip install arcade_google
```

## Auth

The Arcade AI Drive toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](/integrations/auth/google) to connect to users' Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only, not
  for production use. To use Arcade AI and Google Drive in production, you must
  use a self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade AI, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](/integrations/auth/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.

## Available Tools

These tools are currently available in the Arcade AI GitHub toolkit.

<Tip>
  If you need to perform an action that's not listed here, you can [get in touch
  with us](mailto:contact@arcade-ai.com) to request a new tool, or [create your
  own tools](/guides/customtools) with the [GitHub auth
  provider](/integrations/auth/github#using-github-auth-in-customtools).
