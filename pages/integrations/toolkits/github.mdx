The Arcade GitHub toolkit provides a pre-built set of tools for interacting with
GitHub. These tools make it easy to build agents and AI apps that can:

- Access private repositories (with the user's permission)
- Get info about repositories, issues, pull requests, and more
- Post issues, comments, and replies as the user

## Install

```bash
pip install arcade_github
```

## Auth

The Arcade GitHub toolkit uses the
[GitHub auth provider](/integrations/auth/github) to connect to users' GitHub
accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see
`Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only, not
  for production use. To use Arcade AI and GitHub in production, you must use a
  self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade AI, you need to
[configure the GitHub auth provider](/integrations/auth/github#configuring-github-auth)
with your own GitHub app credentials.

## Available Tools

These tools are currently available in the Arcade GitHub toolkit.

  with us](mailto:contact@arcade-ai.com) to request a new tool, or [create your
  own tools](/guides/customtools) with the [GitHub auth
