- **`message`** _(string, required)_ The message you want to send.

## Auth

The Arcade AI Slack toolkit uses the [Slack auth provider](/integrations/auth/slack) to connect to users' Slack accounts.

With the hosted Arcade AI Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only, not
  for production use. To use Arcade AI and Slack in production, you must use a
  self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade AI, you need to [configure the Slack auth provider](/integrations/auth/slack#configuring-slack-auth) with your own Slack app credentials.
