## Auth

The Arcade AI X (Twitter) toolkit uses the [X auth provider](/integrations/auth/x) to connect to users' X (formerly Twitter) accounts.

With the hosted Arcade AI Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only, not
  for production use. To use Arcade AI and X (formerly Twitter) in production,
  you must use a self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade AI, you need to [configure the X auth provider](/integrations/auth/x#configuring-x-auth) with your own X (formerly Twitter) app credentials.
