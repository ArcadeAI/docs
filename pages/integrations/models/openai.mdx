# OpenAI

## Connecting

The default client for connecting to Arcade is the OpenAI Client. To send a chat message to OpenAI through Arcade, you can use the OpenAI
Client as normal, while swapping out the base URL and API Key with Arcade's URL and API Key.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.arcade-ai.com/v1",
    api_key=os.environ.get("ARCADE_API_KEY"))


response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model = "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    user = "user@arcade-ai.com",
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize my last 10 emails"}
    ]
)
```

## Configuration

This is a simple example on enabling OpenAI in the Arcade Engine

```yaml
llm:
  models:
    - id: my-openai-model
      openai:
        api_key: <OPENAI API KEY>
```

For more advanced configuration, see the [model docs](/home/configure/models#openai)
