# Groq

## Connecting

You can send requests to Groq for OpenAI Client compatible models.

<Warning>Groq is currently not currently support on Arcade Cloud, but can be used with a custom engine configuration</Warning>

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:9099/v1",
    api_key=os.environ.get("ARCADE_API_KEY"))


response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model = "llama3",
    user = "user@arcade-ai.com",
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize my last 10 emails"}
    ]
)
```

## Configuration

This is a simple example on enabling Groq in the Arcade Engine

```yaml
llm:
  models:
    - id: groq
      openai:
        base_url: "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"
        api_key: ${env:GROQ_API_KEY}
```

For more advanced configuration, see the [model docs](/home/configure/models#openai)
