# LinkedIn auth provider

The LinkedIn auth provider enables tools and agents to call the LinkedIn API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the LinkedIn auth provider seamlessly manage LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure LinkedIn auth with Arcade AI.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-linkedin-auth-in-your-app-code) that needs to call LinkedIn APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-linkedin-auth-in-customtools) that need to call LinkedIn APIs

## Configuring LinkedIn auth

How you configure the LinkedIn auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

With the Arcade Cloud Engine, you can start building and testing LinkedIn auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the LinkedIn auth provider with your own LinkedIn app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a LinkedIn app

- Follow LinkedIn's guide to [setting up user authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authentication)
- Choose the permissions you need for your app
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade-ai.com/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

### Configuring LinkedIn auth with the Arcade Cloud Engine

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Coming soon! In 0.1.0-preview, the Arcade Cloud Engine does not yet support
  configuring auth providers.
</Warning>

### Configuring LinkedIn auth with a self-hosted Arcade Engine

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `linkedin` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-5}

```

</Steps>

## Using LinkedIn auth in app code

Use the LinkedIn auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for LinkedIn APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for LinkedIn APIs:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/custom_auth.py {8-13}

```

## Using LinkedIn auth in custom tools

The Arcade [LLM API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-llms) is a convenient way to call LLMs and automatically invoke tools. You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with LinkedIn APIs.

Use the `LinkedIn()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with LinkedIn. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's LinkedIn token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/custom_tool.py {8,11-15,34}

```
