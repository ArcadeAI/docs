# X auth provider

The X auth provider enables tools and agents to call the X (Twitter) API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the X auth provider seamlessly manage X OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with X services in your agent or AI app? The
  pre-built [Arcade X toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/x) is what you want!
</Tip>

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure X auth with Arcade AI.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade X toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/x), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with X
- Your [app code](#using-x-auth-in-your-app-code) that needs to call X APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-x-auth-in-customtools) that need to call X APIs

## Configuring X auth

How you configure the X auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade [Cloud Engine](/home/cloud-engine) or a [self-hosted Engine](/guides/installation).

With the Arcade Cloud Engine, you can start building and testing X auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the X auth provider with your own X app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create an X app

- Follow X's guide to [creating an app](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-x-api)
- Configure user authentication for your new app and set its type to "Web app"
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade-ai.com/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

### Configuring X auth with the Arcade Cloud Engine

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Coming soon! In 0.1.0-preview, the Arcade Cloud Engine does not yet support
  configuring auth providers.
</Warning>

### Configuring X auth with a self-hosted Arcade Engine

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export X_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export X_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
X_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
X_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [configuration](/guides/configuration) for more information on how to set
  environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add an `x` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/x/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-5}

```

</Steps>

## Using X auth in app code

Use the X auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the X API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/guides/agentauth) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.authorize()` to get a user token for X:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/x/custom_auth.py {9-13}

```

## Using X auth in custom tools

The Arcade [LLM API](/guides/llmtoolcalling) is a convenient way to call LLMs and automatically invoke tools. You can use the pre-built [Arcade X toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/x) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with X.

If the pre-built tools in the X toolkit don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/guides/customtools) that interact with the X API.

Use the `X()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with X. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's X token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/x/custom_tool.py {7,10-14,22}

```
