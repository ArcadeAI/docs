# GitHub auth provider

The GitHub auth provider enables tools and agents to call GitHub APIs on behalf
of a user. This lets your agents and AI apps:

- Call the
  [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api)
  on behalf of the user
- Access private repositories (with the user's permission)

The GitHub auth provider seamlessly manages GitHub OAuth 2.0 authorization for
your users.

This page describes how to use and configure the GitHub auth provider with
Arcade AI. This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade GitHub toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/github), which provides
  pre-built tools for interacting with GitHub
- Your [custom tools](#using-github-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the
  GitHub API
- Your
  [agents and custom workflows](#using-github-auth-in-agents-and-custom-workflows)
  that need to call the GitHub API

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with GitHub in your AI apps or agents? The
  pre-built [Arcade GitHub toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/github) is what you
  want!

## Configuring GitHub auth

With the [hosted Arcade Engine](/home/hosted-engine), there's nothing to
configure. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application
that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only, not
  for production use. To use Arcade AI and GitHub in production, you must use a
  self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a [self-hosted installation](/guides/installation) of Arcade AI, you need
to configure the GitHub auth provider with your own GitHub app credentials.

<Steps>

### Create a GitHub app

- Follow GitHub's guide to
  [registering a GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app)
- Choose the permissions you need for your app
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade-ai.com/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [configuration](/guides/configuration) for more information on how to set
  environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Configure Arcade Engine

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and set the following values in the `auth.providers`
section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/github/engine.example.yaml

```

</Steps>

## Using GitHub auth in custom tools

If the tools available in the
[Arcade GitHub toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/github) don't meet your needs,
you can author your own [custom tools](/guides/custom-tools) that call the
GitHub API. The GitHub auth provider works with any custom tool that needs to
call the GitHub API.

Use the `GitHub()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with
GitHub. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated
with the user's GitHub token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/github/custom_tool.py {2,5,13}

```

## Using GitHub auth in agents and custom workflows

You can use the GitHub auth provider in your own agents and custom workflows
without defining tools, if that better fits your codebase. See
[authorizing agents with Arcade](/guides/agentauth) for more context on how this
works.

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/github/custom_auth.py {1,7}

```
