# Spotify auth provider

The Spotify auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Spotify API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Spotify auth provider seamlessly manage Spotify OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Spotify auth with Arcade AI.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-spotify-auth-in-your-app-code) that needs to call Spotify APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-spotify-auth-in-customtools) that need to call Spotify APIs

## Configuring Spotify auth

How you configure the Spotify auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

With the Arcade Cloud Engine, you can start building and testing Spotify auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the Spotify auth provider with your own Spotify app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a Spotify app

- Follow Spotify's guide to [registering an app](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade-ai.com/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

### Configuring Spotify auth with the Arcade Cloud Engine

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Coming soon! In 0.1.0-preview, the Arcade Cloud Engine does not yet support
  configuring auth providers.
</Warning>

### Configuring Spotify auth with a self-hosted Arcade Engine

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `spotify` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-5}

```

</Steps>

## Using Spotify auth in app code

Use the Spotify auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Spotify API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Spotify API:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

## Using Spotify auth in custom tools

The Arcade [LLM API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-llms) is a convenient way to call LLMs and automatically invoke tools. You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Spotify API.

Use the `Spotify()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Spotify. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Spotify token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,19}

```
