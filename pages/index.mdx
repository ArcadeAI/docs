## Welcome to Arcade AI!

Arcade AI bridges the gap between LLM applications and the real world by providing authenticated tool-calling for developers. Traditional AI systems are powerful yet isolated, lacking the means to interact with external data and services securely. Arcade AI solves this by offering a platform where AI can perform real-world actions on behalf of users, access user-specific data, and integrate with a wide range of services.
