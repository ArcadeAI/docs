## Welcome to Arcade AI!

Arcade helps developers with agent auth and tool calling. Arcade offers three integration options:

- **Agent Auth API**: Securely manage user tokens for services like Slack or Gmail in LLM and agent workflows.
- **Tools API**: Run Arcade-built tools for popular services or your own custom tools built with our SDK.
- **LLM API**: Invoke language models from multiple providers, with automatic tool injection and execution.

Arcade offers flexible deployment options: fully hosted cloud service or in your own environment. Set up within minutes
