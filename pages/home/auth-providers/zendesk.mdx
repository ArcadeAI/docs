# Zendesk Auth Provider

<Note>
  Arcade does not offer a default Zendesk Auth Provider. To use Zendesk auth, you must create
  a [custom provider configuration](/home/auth-providers/oauth2) as described below.
</Note>

The Zendesk auth provider enables tools and agents to call Zendesk APIs on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Zendesk auth provider seamlessly manage Zendesk OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

## What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Zendesk auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Zendesk toolkit](/mcp-servers/customer-support/zendesk), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Zendesk services
- Your [app code](#using-zendesk-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Zendesk APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-zendesk-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Zendesk APIs

## Create a Zendesk app

<Note>
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to use a [custom user verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in production.
</Note>

### Additional guides
The following three guides from Zendesk will be helpful additional information as you progress through this guide:
1. [Using OAuth authentication with your application](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408845965210-Using-OAuth-authentication-with-your-application)
2. [Set up a global OAuth client](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/marketplace/building-a-marketplace-app/set-up-a-global-oauth-client/)
3. [Getting a trial or sponsored account for development](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/api-basics/getting-started/getting-a-trial-or-sponsored-account-for-development/)

### Creating a Zendesk app for Arcade
1. Create your Organization in the [Zendesk Marketplace portal](https://apps.zendesk.com/).
1. Create a Zendesk support account at https://www.zendesk.com/login . If you need a global OAuth client, then the subdomain MUST begin with "d3v-". You will need a global OAuth client if your app will use integrations/tools for multiple customers with their own Zendesk instances (multiple subdomains).
1. In [the Admin Center](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4581766374554#topic_hfg_dyz_1hb), click "Apps and integrations" in the sidebar, then select APIs > OAuth clients > Add OAuth client.
    * Ensure your identifier is prefixed with "zdg-" if you will need a global OAuth client.
    * Select "Public" for "Client kind".
    * Use the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below) as your "Redirect URL".
1. Copy and store your identifier for later. This will be your **Client ID**.
1. Copy and store your generated secret for later. This will be your **Client Secret**.
1. (Only for Global OAuth client) Request a global OAuth client.
    * First, you will need to request a sponsored account and wait for approval from Zendesk. You can request a sponsored account [here](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/api-basics/getting-started/getting-a-trial-or-sponsored-account-for-development/#requesting-a-sponsored-test-account).
    * When filling out the sponsored account request form, ensure you select "App Developer / ISV" as your Developer Type.
    * After you have a sponsored account, sign into the [Zendesk Marketplace portal](https://apps.zendesk.com/)
    * Organization > Global OAuth Request and fill out the form. Zendesk will typically review your request within 1 week.



## Get your Zendesk subdomain

Your Zendesk subdomain is the value before the `.zendesk.com` part. For example, if your Zendesk domain is `https://d3v-acme-inc.zendesk.com`, your Zendesk subdomain is `d3v-acme-inc`. Take note of your Zendesk subdomain. You will need this value in the next steps.

## Set the Zendesk Subdomain Secret

Set the `ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN` secret in the [Arcade Dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/secrets).

## Configuring Zendesk Auth

You can either configure Zendesk auth from the Arcade Dashboard or in the `engine.yaml` file if you are running the Engine yourself. We describe both options below.

### Configure Zendesk Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

Navigate to the [Arcade Dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/oauth) OAuth Providers page.

#### Navigate to the Add Custom Provider page

- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Click the **Custom Provider** tab at the top.

#### Enter the provider details

- ID: `zendesk`
- Description: `<your description>`
- Client ID: `<your identifier>` (This is prefixed with `zdg-` if you are using a global OAuth client)
- Client Secret: `<your client secret>`
- Authorization Endpoint: `https://<your-zendesk-subdomain>.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new`
- Token Endpoint: `https://<your-zendesk-subdomain>.zendesk.com/oauth/tokens`
- PKCE Settings:
  - Enable PKCE: `enabled`
  - PKCE Method: `S256` (Default)
- Authorization Settings:
  - Response Type: `code` (Default)
  - Scope: `{{scopes}} {{existing_scopes}}` (Default)
- Token Settings:
  - Authentication Method: `Client Secret Basic` (Default)
  - Response Content Type: `application/json` (Default)
- Refresh Token Settings:
  - Refresh Token Endpoint: `https://<your-zendesk-subdomain>.zendesk.com/oauth/tokens`
  - Authentication Method: `Client Secret Basic` (Default)
  - Response Content Type: `application/json`
- Token Introspection Settings:
  - Enable Token Introspection: `disabled` (Default)

Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Zendesk app's redirect URL.

</Steps>

### Configure Zendesk Auth Using the Engine Configuration YAML

<Tip>
  Refer to [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  To find where the `engine.yaml` file is located in your OS after installing the Arcade Engine, check the [Engine configuration file](/home/local-deployment/configure/overview#engine-configuration-file) documentation.
</Tip>

<Steps>

#### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export ZENDESK_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export ZENDESK_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
ZENDESK_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
ZENDESK_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

#### Edit the Engine configuration

<Note>
  In the YAML code demonstrated below, replace `<your-zendesk-subdomain>` in the endpoint URLs with your Zendesk subdomain.
</Note>

Edit the `engine.yaml` file by adding a Zendesk item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/zendesk/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-43}

```

#### Restart the Arcade Engine

If the Arcade Engine is already running, you will need to restart it for the changes to take effect.

</Steps>

## Using Zendesk auth in app code

Use the Zendesk auth provider you just created in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for Zendesk APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for Zendesk APIs:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/zendesk/custom_auth.py {6-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/zendesk/custom_auth.js {8-11}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Zendesk auth in custom tools

If the [Arcade Zendesk toolkit](/mcp-servers/customer-support/zendesk) does not meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with Zendesk APIs.

Use the `OAuth2()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Zendesk. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Zendesk token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/zendesk/custom_tool.py

```
