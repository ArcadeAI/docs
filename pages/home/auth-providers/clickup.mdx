# ClickUp auth provider

The ClickUp auth provider enables tools and agents to call the ClickUp API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the ClickUp auth provider seamlessly manage ClickUp OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure ClickUp auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-clickup-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call ClickUp APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-clickup-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call ClickUp APIs

## Configuring ClickUp auth
<Note>
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to use a [custom user verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in production.
</Note>
In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own ClickUp app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own ClickUp credentials in both the Arcade Cloud Platform or in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your ClickUp app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a ClickUp app.

### Create a ClickUp app

- Navigate to your ClickUp workspace and go to **Settings â†’ Apps**
- Click **Create new app** in the OAuth Apps section
- Fill in your app name and description
- Set the OAuth Redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the Client ID and Client Secret, which you'll need below

Next, add the ClickUp app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own ClickUp Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your ClickUp app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

### Configure ClickUp Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **ClickUp**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-clickup-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your ClickUp app.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require ClickUp auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this ClickUp OAuth provider. If you have multiple ClickUp providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring ClickUp auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export CLICKUP_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export CLICKUP_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
CLICKUP_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
CLICKUP_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `clickup` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/clickup/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using ClickUp auth in app code

Use the ClickUp auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the ClickUp API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the ClickUp API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/clickup/clickup_custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/clickup/clickup_custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using ClickUp auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the ClickUp API.

Use the `ClickUp()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with ClickUp. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's ClickUp token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/clickup/clickup_custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,20}

```
