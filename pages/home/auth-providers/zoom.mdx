# Zoom auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Zoom Auth Provider. To use Zoom auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Zoom OAuth 2.0 credentials.
</Note>

The Zoom auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Zoom API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Zoom auth provider seamlessly manage Zoom OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Zoom auth with Arcade AI.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-zoom-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Zoom APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-zoom-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Zoom APIs

## Configuring Zoom auth

How you configure the Zoom auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the Zoom auth provider with your own Zoom app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a Zoom app

- Follow Zoom's guide to [registering an app](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/create/) on the Zoom marketplace
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback` and enable Strict Mode
- Enable the Zoom features and permissions (scopes) that your app needs
- Copy the client ID and client secret

### Configuring Zoom auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Zoom** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-zoom-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Zoom app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Zoom auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Zoom OAuth provider.

### Configuring Zoom auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `zoom` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/zoom/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Zoom auth in app code

Use the Zoom auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Zoom API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Zoom API:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/zoom/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

## Using Zoom auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Zoom API.

Use the `Zoom()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Zoom. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Zoom token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/zoom/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,23}

```
