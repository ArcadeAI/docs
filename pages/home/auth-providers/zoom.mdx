# Zoom auth provider

The Zoom auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Zoom API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Zoom auth provider seamlessly manage Zoom OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Zoom auth with Arcade AI.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-zoom-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Zoom APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-zoom-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Zoom APIs

## Configuring Zoom auth

How you configure the Zoom auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

With the Arcade Cloud Engine, you can start building and testing Zoom auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade AI demo` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the Zoom auth provider with your own Zoom app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a Zoom app

- Follow Zoom's guide to [registering an app](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/create/) on the Zoom marketplace
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade-ai.com/api/v1/oauth/callback` and enable Strict Mode
- Enable the Zoom features and permissions (scopes) that your app needs
- Copy the client ID and client secret

### Configuring Zoom auth with the Arcade Cloud Engine

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Coming soon! In 0.1.0-preview, the Arcade Cloud Engine does not yet support
  configuring auth providers.
</Warning>

### Configuring Zoom auth with a self-hosted Arcade Engine

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `zoom` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/zoom/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Zoom auth in app code

Use the Zoom auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Zoom API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Zoom API:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/zoom/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

## Using Zoom auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Zoom API.

Use the `Zoom()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Zoom. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Zoom token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/zoom/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,23}

```
