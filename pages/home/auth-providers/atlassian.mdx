# Atlassian auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Atlassian Auth Provider. To use
  Atlassian auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Atlassian
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Atlassian auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Atlassian API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Atlassian auth provider seamlessly manage Atlassian OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Atlassian auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-atlassian-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Atlassian APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-atlassian-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Atlassian APIs

## Configuring Atlassian auth

<Note>
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to use a [custom user verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in production.
</Note>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Atlassian app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Atlassian credentials in both the Arcade Cloud Platform or in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Atlassian app credentials, let's go through the steps to create an Atlassian app.

### Create an Atlassian app

- Create a Atlassian app in the [Atlassian developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)
- In the Authorization tab, click the "Add" action button and set the Callback URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the Permissions tab, enable any permissions you need for your app
- In the Settings tab, copy the Client ID and Secret to use below

## Configuring your own Atlassian Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Atlassian app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure Atlassian Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Atlassian**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-atlassian-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Atlassian app.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>
When you use tools that require Atlassian auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Atlassian OAuth provider. If you have multiple Atlassian providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Atlassian auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `atlassian` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Atlassian auth in app code

Use the Atlassian auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Atlassian API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Atlassian API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Atlassian auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Atlassian API.

Use the `Atlassian()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Atlassian. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Atlassian token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,23}

```
