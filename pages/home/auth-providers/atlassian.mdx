# Atlassian auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Atlassian auth provider. To use this auth provider, you must create your own custom Auth Provider by providing your own Atlassian app credentials.
</Note>

The Atlassian auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Atlassian API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Atlassian auth provider seamlessly manage Atlassian OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Atlassian auth with Arcade AI.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-atlassian-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Atlassian APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-atlassian-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Atlassian APIs

## Configuring Atlassian auth

At the moment, you can only configure Atlassian auth with a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

### Create a Atlassian app

- Create a Atlassian app in the [Atlassian developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)
- In the Authorization tab, click the "Add" action button and set the Callback URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the Permissions tab, set any permissions you need for your app
- In the Settings tab, copy the Client ID and Secret to use later

### Configuring Atlassian auth with the Arcade Cloud Engine

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Coming soon! In 0.1.0-preview, the Arcade Cloud Engine does not yet support
  configuring auth providers.
</Warning>

### Configuring Atlassian auth with a self-hosted Arcade Engine

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `atlassian` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Atlassian auth in app code

Use the Atlassian auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Atlassian API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Atlassian API:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

## Using Atlassian auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Atlassian API.

Use the `Atlassian()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Atlassian. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Atlassian token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,23}

```
