# Discord auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Discord Auth Provider. To use
  Discord auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Discord
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Discord auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Discord API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Discord auth provider seamlessly manage Discord OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Discord auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-discord-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Discord APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-discord-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Discord APIs

## Configuring Discord auth

### Create a Discord app

- Create a Discord Application in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- In the OAuth2 tab, set the redirect URI to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the Client ID and Client Secret (you may need to reset the secret to see it)

Next, add the Discord app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring Discord auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Discord** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-discord-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Discord app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Discord auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Discord OAuth provider.

### Configuring Discord auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `discord` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Discord auth in app code

Use the Discord auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Discord API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Discord API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Discord auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Discord API.

Use the `Discord()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Discord. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Discord token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,23}

```
