# Discord auth provider

The Discord auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Discord API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Discord auth provider seamlessly manage Discord OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Discord auth with Arcade AI.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-discord-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Discord APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-discord-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Discord APIs

## Configuring Discord auth

At the moment, you can only configure Discord auth with a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

### Create a Discord app

- Create a Discord Application in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- In the OAuth2 tab, set the redirect URI to: `https://cloud.arcade-ai.com/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the Client ID and Client Secret (you may need to reset the secret to see it)

### Configuring Discord auth with the Arcade Cloud Engine

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Coming soon! In 0.1.0-preview, the Arcade Cloud Engine does not yet support
  configuring auth providers.
</Warning>

### Configuring Discord auth with a self-hosted Arcade Engine

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `discord` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-5}

```

</Steps>

## Using Discord auth in app code

Use the Discord auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Discord API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Discord API:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

## Using Discord auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Discord API.

Use the `Discord()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Discord. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Discord token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,23}

```
