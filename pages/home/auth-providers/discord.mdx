# Discord auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Discord Auth Provider. To use
  Discord auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Discord
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Discord auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Discord API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Discord auth provider seamlessly manage Discord OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Discord auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-discord-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Discord APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-discord-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Discord APIs

## Configuring Discord auth

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Discord app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Discord credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Discord app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Discord app.

### Create a Discord app

- Create a Discord Application in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- In the OAuth2 tab, set the redirect URI to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the Client ID and Client Secret (you may need to reset the secret to see it)

Next, add the Discord app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Discord Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Atlassian app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>

### Configure Discord Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Discord**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-discord-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Discord app.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Discord auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Discord OAuth provider. If you have multiple Discord providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Discord auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `discord` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Discord auth in app code

Use the Discord auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Discord API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Discord API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Discord auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Discord API.

Use the `Discord()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Discord. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Discord token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/discord/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,23}

```
