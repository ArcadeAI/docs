# LinkedIn auth provider

The LinkedIn auth provider enables tools and agents to call the LinkedIn API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the LinkedIn auth provider seamlessly manage LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure LinkedIn auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-linkedin-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call LinkedIn APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-linkedin-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call LinkedIn APIs

## Configuring LinkedIn auth

<Note>
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to use a [custom user verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in production.
</Note>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own LinkedIn app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own LinkedIn credentials in both the Arcade Cloud Platform or in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your LinkedIn app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a LinkedIn app.

### Create a LinkedIn app

- Follow LinkedIn's guide to [setting up user authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authentication)
- On the Products tab, add the products you need for your app (e.g. "Share on LinkedIn")
  - At a minimum, you _must_ add the "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" product
- On the Auth tab, set the redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the LinkedIn app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own LinkedIn Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your LinkedIn app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure LinkedIn Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **LinkedIn**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-linkedin-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your LinkedIn app.
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your LinkedIn app's redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require LinkedIn auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this LinkedIn OAuth provider. If you have multiple LinkedIn providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring LinkedIn auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `linkedin` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using LinkedIn auth in app code

Use the LinkedIn auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for LinkedIn APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for LinkedIn APIs:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/custom_auth.py {23-27}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/custom_auth.js {20-22}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using LinkedIn auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with LinkedIn APIs.

Use the `LinkedIn()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with LinkedIn. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's LinkedIn token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/custom_tool.py {6-7,10-14,33}

```
