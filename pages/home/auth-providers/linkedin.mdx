# LinkedIn auth provider

The LinkedIn auth provider enables tools and agents to call the LinkedIn API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the LinkedIn auth provider seamlessly manage LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure LinkedIn auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-linkedin-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call LinkedIn APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-linkedin-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call LinkedIn APIs

## Configuring LinkedIn auth

How you configure the LinkedIn auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

With the Arcade Cloud Engine, you can start building and testing LinkedIn auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the LinkedIn auth provider with your own LinkedIn app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a LinkedIn app

- Follow LinkedIn's guide to [setting up user authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authentication)
- On the Products tab, add the products you need for your app (e.g. "Share on LinkedIn")
  - At a minimum, you *must* add the "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" product
- On the Auth tab, set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the LinkedIn app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring LinkedIn auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **LinkedIn** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-linkedin-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your LinkedIn app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require LinkedIn auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this LinkedIn OAuth provider.

### Configuring LinkedIn auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `linkedin` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using LinkedIn auth in app code

Use the LinkedIn auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for LinkedIn APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for LinkedIn APIs:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/custom_auth.py {23-27}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/custom_auth.js {20-22}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using LinkedIn auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with LinkedIn APIs.

Use the `LinkedIn()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with LinkedIn. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's LinkedIn token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/linkedin/custom_tool.py {6-7,10-14,33}

```
