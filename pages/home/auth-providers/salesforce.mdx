# Salesforce Auth Provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Salesforce Auth Provider and cannot support Salesforce auth in the Arcade Cloud. To use Salesforce auth, the [Salesforce toolkit](/toolkits/sales/salesforce), or to develop your [custom Salesforce tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit), you must [self-host the Arcade Engine](/home/install/local) and create a custom Auth Provider with your own Salesforce OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Salesforce auth provider enables tools and agents to call Salesforce APIs on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Salesforce auth provider seamlessly manage Salesforce OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

## What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Salesforce auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](/toolkits/sales/salesforce), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Salesforce services
- Your [app code](#calling-salesforce-apis-directly) that needs to call Salesforce APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#create-your-own-salesforce-tools) that need to call Salesforce APIs

## Create a Salesforce app

Salesforce has two types of apps: **Connected App** and **Lightning App**. For this guide, we'll create a **Connected App**. Make sure to follow the instructions below while you [create your Connected App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.connected_app_create.htm&type=5).

When creating your app, make sure to:

- Under "API (Enable OAuth Settings)", check the **Enable OAuth Settings** box
- Set the callback URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the **Available OAuth Scopes**, add the two following scopes:
  - "Manage User Data Via APIs (api)"
  - "Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)"
- Uncheck the **Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** option, unless you want to use PKCE (in which case, you'll also need to enable PKCE in the Salesforce auth configuration as [described below](#configuring-salesforce-auth))
- Check "Enable Token Exchange Flow"
- Check "Enable Refresh Token Rotation"
- Leave all other settings as default and save your app

Right after creating the app, Salesforce will redirect you to the app's page. In the "API (Enable OAuth Settings)" section, click on the **Manage Consumer Details** button and take note of the **API Key** and **Client Secret** values.

Then, go back to the App's page and click on the **Manage** button at the top, then click on the **Edit Policies** button, at the top of the Manage page, and follow the instructions below:

- In "IP Relaxation", select **Relax IP Restrictions**.
- In "Refresh Token Policy", make sure the option **Refresh token is valid until revoked** is checked.

With that, your Salesforce app is ready to be used with Arcade.

## Get your Salesforce Org Subdomain

Follow the steps below to find your Salesforce Org Subdomain:

1. In the Setup menu, click on **Quick Find** in the top left corner and type `"my domain"`.
1. In the search results, under **Company Settings**, click on **My Domain**.
1. Under **My Domain Details**, check the value of the **Current My Domain URL** field.

Your **Salesforce Org Subdomain** is the value before the `.my.salesforce.com` part. For example, if your Salesforce domain is `https://acme-inc.my.salesforce.com`, your Salesforce Org Subdomain is `acme-inc`. If you have a developer account, your URL might look like `https://acme-inc.develop.my.salesforce.com`. In this case, your Salesforce Org Subdomain is `acme-inc.develop`.

Take note of your Salesforce Org Subdomain. You will need this value in the next steps.

## Set the Salesforce Org Subdomain Environment Variable

{/* The step is right before, but the note is intended for people coming from different pages that link directly to this sub-heading */}
<Note>
  Refer to the [previous step](#get-your-salesforce-org-subdomain) to find your Salesforce Org Subdomain.
</Note>

Set the `SALESFORCE_ORG_SUBDOMAIN` environment variable in the same runtime where your Arcade Worker is executed:

```bash
export SALESFORCE_ORG_SUBDOMAIN={your-salesforce-subdomain}
```

## Create and Assign Custom Scopes to your Connected App

The Salesforce API requires the App developer to create [OAuth custom scopes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_customscopes.htm&type=5) defining granular permissions for their application users to authorize.

The custom scopes required by the [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](/toolkits/sales/salesforce) are listed below, along with their descriptions:

<Note>
  The custom scopes listed below are only required if you are using the [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](/toolkits/sales/salesforce).

  If you're creating your own [custom Salesforce tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) or using Arcade to authorize users and call Salesforce APIs directly, you are free to define custom scope(s) that fit best your application use cases. Observe that you must have at least one custom scope assigned to your Salesforce app in order to use the Salesforce API.
</Note>

- `read_account`: Read access to account data.
- `read_contact`: Read access to contact data.
- `read_lead`: Read access to lead data.
- `read_note`: Read access to note data.
- `read_opportunity`: Read access to opportunity data.
- `read_task`: Read access to task data.
- `write_contact`: Write access to create contact.

Follow the [Create an OAuth Custom Scope](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_customscopes_create.htm&type=5) and [Assign an OAuth Custom Scope to a Connected App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.remoteaccess_oauth_customscopes_assign.htm&type=5) Salesforce documentation to understand how to define and assign these scopes to your Salesforce app.

<Tip>
  The scope names aren't really attached to any endpoint or action. It's the developer's job to honor the permissions communicated to the user when authorizing the app. You could, in theory, assign one single scope (e.g. `fullaccess`) and use it to query any Salesforce API endpoint.
</Tip>

## Configuring Salesforce Auth

<Note>
  Refer to [Installing Arcade Locally](/home/install/local) for more information on how to install and run the Arcade Engine.
</Note>

You can either configure Salesforce auth from the Arcade Engine Dashboard graphical interface or in the `engine.yaml` file. We describe both options below.


<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure Salesforce Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

By default, the Arcade Dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard` (if you're accessing it from the same machine where it's running). Change the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Custom Provider** tab at the top.

#### Enter the provider details

- Enter `salesforce` as the **ID** for your provider (the ID must be `salesforce` in order to use the [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](/toolkits/sales/salesforce)).
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Salesforce app.

#### Configure the auth endpoints

<Note>
  Replace `salesforce-org-subdomain` with your [Salesforce Org Subdomain](#get-your-salesforce-org-subdomain).
</Note>

- Enter the auth endpoints:
  - **Authorization Endpoint**: `https://salesforce-org-subdomain.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize`
  - **Token Endpoint**: `https://salesforce-org-subdomain.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`
- Under **Refresh Token Settings**:
  - Enter the **Refresh Token Endpoint**: `https://salesforce-org-subdomain.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`
  - In **Response Content Type**, select `application/json`.
- Under **Token Introspection Settings**:
  - Check the **Enable Token Introspection** option.
  - Enter the **Token Introspection Endpoint**: `https://salesforce-org-subdomain.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/introspect`
  - In **Request Content Type**, select `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
  - In **Response Content Type**, select `application/json`.
  - In **Response Map**, enter:
    - **Expires In**: `$.exp`
    - **Scope**: `$.scope`
  - In **Expiration Format**, select `absolute_unix_timestamp`.
  - In **Triggers**, check the **On Token Grant** and **On Token Refresh** options.

#### Optional Auth Settings

- Under **PKCE Settings**, check the **Enable PKCE** option if you have enabled PKCE when creating your Salesforce app.
- Leave the **Authorization Settings** and **Token Settings** sections as default.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

### Configure Salesforce Auth Using the Engine Configuration YAML

<Tip>
  Refer to [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  To find where the `engine.yaml` file is located in your OS after installing the Arcade Engine, check the [Engine configuration file](/home/configure/overview#engine-configuration-file) documentation.
</Tip>

<Steps>

#### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

#### Edit the Engine configuration

<Note>
  In the YAML code demonstrated below, replace `salesforce-org-subdomain` in the endpoint URLs with your [Salesforce Org Subdomain](#get-your-salesforce-org-subdomain).
</Note>

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a Salesforce item to the `auth.providers` section:

<Note>
  The `id` must be set to `salesforce` in order to use the [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](/toolkits/sales/salesforce).
</Note>

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/salesforce/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-31}

```

#### Optionally Enable PKCE

If you have enabled PKCE when creating your Salesforce app, you must also enable PKCE in the Salesforce auth provider configuration by setting the `pkce` option to `true`.

```yaml {6-6}
auth:
  providers:
    - id: salesforce
      description: "Custom Salesforce provider"
      enabled: true
      pkce: true
      ...
```

#### Restart the Arcade Engine

If the Arcade Engine is already running, you will need to restart it for the changes to take effect.

## Using the Arcade Salesforce Toolkit

The [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](/toolkits/sales/salesforce) provides tools to interact with various Salesforce objects, such as accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, notes, tasks, email messages, call logs, etc.

Refer to the [toolkit documentation and examples](/toolkits/sales/salesforce) to learn how to use the toolkit to build agents and AI apps that interact with Salesforce services.

<Tip>
  Check our introductory documentation to understand what are tools and how [tool calling works](/home/use-tools/tools-overview).
</Tip>

## Calling Salesforce APIs directly

Use the Salesforce auth provider to get a user authorization token and call Salesforce API endpoints directly, without the use of any tools. See [How Arcade helps with Agent Authorization](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

### Prerequisites

1. Create an <SignupLink utmParams={{
            utm_source: "docs",
            utm_medium: "page",
            utm_campaign: "salesforce-auth-provider",
          }} linkLocation="docs:/home/auth-providers/salesforce">Arcade account</SignupLink>
1. Get an [Arcade API key](/home/api-keys).
1. Set the `ARCADE_API_KEY` environment variable with `export ARCADE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>`.
1. Make sure to have Python 3.10+ or Node.js 18+ installed.

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]}>

<Steps>

### Install the Arcade Python Client

```python
pip install arcadepy
```

### Import necessary modules and instantiate the client

Create a new script called `salesforce_example.py`. Import the necessary modules and instantiate the Arcade client:

<Note>
  The Arcade Engine service is available at `http://localhost:9099` by default. Replace the host and port, if necessary, to match your environment.
</Note>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/salesforce/custom_auth.py#L1-L4 {4-4}
```

### Set the values required for the Salesforce API call

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/salesforce/custom_auth.py#L6-L9
```

Here's a break down of each value:

- **`salesforce_provider_id`**: the ID you entered when setting up the [Salesforce auth provider](#configuring-salesforce-auth);
- **`salesforce_org_subdomain`**: your [Salesforce Org Subdomain](#get-your-salesforce-org-subdomain);
- **`user_id`**: an internal identifier for your application user (it could be an email address, a username, UUID, etc); for demonstration purposes, in this example, enter your own email address;
- **`scopes`**: the list of scopes you want to request from the user; if you assigned the [custom scopes required by the Arcade Salesforce toolkit](create-and-assign-custom-scopes-to-your-connected-app) use `["read_account"]` in this example.

### Start the authorization process and wait for completion

The Arcade client will prompt the user to access a URL and authorize the app to access their Salesforce data. At the end of the auth process, you will have a token that can be used to call Salesforce APIs on behalf of that user.

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/salesforce/custom_auth.py#L12-L28 {25-25}
```

<Tip>
  If the same scopes have already been authorized by the user before and the token is still valid, the auth process will be skipped and the token will be returned immediately, without prompting with the authorization URL. The Arcade Engine associates a previously authorized token with the `user_id` you provided.
</Tip>

### Call the Salesforce API

We will now call the Salesforce `/parameterizedSearch` API endpoint to search and retrieve account data.

<Note>
  Replace the `q` value of `"acme"` with any keyword combination of your choice. In a real-world scenario, this value would most likely come from a user's input. Observe that the `q` argument must be a string with two or more characters.
</Note>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/salesforce/custom_auth.py#L31-L48 {35-35}

### Install the Arcade JavaScript Client

```javascript
npm install @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

### Import necessary modules and instantiate the client

Create a new script called `salesforce_example.js`. Import the necessary modules and instantiate the Arcade client:

<Note>
  Replace `http://localhost:9099` with the URL of your Arcade Engine.
</Note>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/salesforce/custom_auth.js#L1-L3 {3-3}
```

### Set the values required for the Salesforce API call

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/salesforce/custom_auth.js#L5-L8
```

Here's a break down of each value:

- **`salesforceProviderId`**: the ID you entered when setting up the [Salesforce auth provider](#configuring-salesforce-auth);
- **`salesforceOrgSubdomain`**: your [Salesforce Org Subdomain](#get-your-salesforce-org-subdomain);
- **`userId`**: an internal identifier for your application user (it could be an email address, a username, UUID, etc); for demonstration purposes, in this example, enter your own email address;
- **`scopes`**: the list of scopes you want to request from the user; if you assigned the [custom scopes required by the Arcade Salesforce toolkit](create-and-assign-custom-scopes-to-your-connected-app) use `["read_account"]` in this example.

### Start the authorization process and wait for completion

The Arcade client will prompt the user to access a URL and authorize the app to access their Salesforce data. At the end of the auth process, you will have a token that can be used to call Salesforce APIs on behalf of that user.

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/salesforce/custom_auth.js#L11-L31 {27-27}
```

<Tip>
  If the same scopes have already been authorized by the user before and the token is still valid, the auth process will be skipped and the token will be returned immediately, without prompting with the authorization URL. The Arcade Engine associates a previously authorized token with the `user_id` you provide.
</Tip>

### Call the Salesforce API

We will now call the Salesforce `/parameterizedSearch` API endpoint to search and retrieve account data.

## Create your own Salesforce Tools

If the pre-built tools in the [Arcade Salesforce toolkit](/toolkits/sales/salesforce) don't meet your needs, you can create your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Salesforce APIs.

The code implemented in the Arcade Salesforce tools is the best guide for you to understand how to implement your own. Check the [Contact](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/blob/main/toolkits/salesforce/arcade_salesforce/tools/crm/contact.py) and [Account](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai/blob/main/toolkits/salesforce/arcade_salesforce/tools/crm/account.py) tools in our public Github repository.
