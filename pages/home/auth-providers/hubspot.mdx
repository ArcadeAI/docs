# Hubspot auth provider

The Hubspot auth provider enables tools and agents to call Hubspot APIs on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Hubspot auth provider seamlessly manage Hubspot OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with Hubspot services in your agent or AI app? The
  pre-built [Arcade Hubspot toolkit](/toolkits/sales/hubspot) is what
  you want!
