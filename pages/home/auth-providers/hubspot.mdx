# Hubspot auth provider

The Hubspot auth provider enables tools and agents to call Hubspot APIs on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Hubspot auth provider seamlessly manage Hubspot OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with Hubspot services in your agent or AI app? The
  pre-built [Arcade Hubspot toolkit](/toolkits/sales/hubspot) is what
  you want!
</Tip>

## What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Hubspot auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Hubspot toolkit](/toolkits/sales/hubspot), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Hubspot
- Your [app code](#using-hubspot-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Hubspot APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-hubspot-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Hubspot APIs

## Use Arcade's Default Hubspot Auth Provider

Arcade offers a default Hubspot auth provider that you can use in the Arcade Cloud. In this case, your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

If you choose to use Arcade's Hubspot auth, you don't need to configure anything. Follow the [Hubspot toolkit examples](/toolkits/sales/hubspot) to get started calling Hubspot tools.

## Use Your Own Hubspot App Credentials

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Hubspot app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Hubspot credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Hubspot app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Hubspot app.

## Create a Hubspot App

Hubspot has two types of apps: Public and Private. You will need to create a Public one.

Follow [Hubspot's tutorial](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/public-apps/overview) to create your Public App. You will need a [developer account](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers) to do this.

When creating your app, use the following settings:

- Under **App Info**, choose a name, description, and logo for your app
- Under **Auth**, enter the **Redirect URL**: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the **Scopes** section, click **Add Scope** and add the following scopes with the **Conditionally Required** scope type:
  - `crm.objects.companies.read`
  - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
  - `crm.objects.contacts.write`
  - `crm.objects.deals.read`
  - `sales-email-read`

Create the app and take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You don't need to follow Hubspot's instructions to install the app.

<Note>
  If you are implementing your own [Hubspot custom tools](#using-hubspot-auth-in-custom-tools), make sure to also add [any extra scopes](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/authentication/scopes) necessary for the actions your tools need to perform.
</Note>

## Configuring your own Hubspot Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Hubspot app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (only possible with a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure Hubspot Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Hubspot**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Enter `hubspot` as the **ID** for your provider
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Hubspot app.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.
</Steps>

### Configure Hubspot Auth Using the Engine Configuration YAML

<Tip>
  Refer to [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

<Steps>

#### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

#### Edit the Engine configuration

<Tip>
  To locate the `engine.yaml` file in your OS after installing the Arcade Engine, check the [Engine configuration file](/home/configure/overview#engine-configuration-file) documentation.
</Tip>

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a Hubspot item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/hubspot/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

#### Restart the Arcade Engine

If the Arcade Engine is already running, you will need to restart it for the changes to take effect.

## Using the Arcade Hubspot Toolkit

The [Arcade Hubspot toolkit](/toolkits/sales/hubspot) provides tools to interact with various Hubspot objects, such as companies, contacts, deals, and email messages.

Refer to the [toolkit documentation and examples](/toolkits/sales/hubspot) to learn how to use the toolkit to build agents and AI apps that interact with Hubspot services.

## Using Hubspot auth in app code

Use the Hubspot auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Hubspot API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Hubspot API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
<Note>
  If you are [self-hosting Arcade](/home/install/overview), change the `base_url` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.
</Note>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/hubspot/custom_auth.py {21}

```
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
<Note>
  If you are [self-hosting Arcade](/home/install/overview), change the `baseURL` parameter in the `Arcade` constructor to match your Arcade Engine URL. By default, the Engine will be available at `http://localhost:9099`.
</Note>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/hubspot/custom_auth.js {20}

```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

You can use the auth token to call [Hubspot Companies endpoints](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/api/crm/objects/companies) and read information about companies. By changing or adding scopes to the `client.auth.start` call, you can call other Hubspot endpoints.

The scopes supported by the Arcade Hubspot auth provider are the ones [listed above](#create-a-hubspot-app). If you created your own Hubspot app, make sure to add the scopes you intend to use in the `client.auth.start` call.

## Using Hubspot auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Hubspot API.

Use the `Hubspot()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Hubspot. The authentication token needed to call the Hubspot API is available in the tool context through the `context.get_auth_token_or_empty()` method.

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/hubspot/custom_tool.py {10,23}

```

If you are [self-hosting Arcade](/home/install/overview), you will need to restart the Arcade Worker and the Engine for the new tool to be available.

Your new tool can be called like demonstrated below:
