# Google auth provider

The Google auth provider enables tools and agents to call Google/Google Workspace APIs on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Google auth provider seamlessly manage Google OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with Google services in your agent or AI app? The
  pre-built [Arcade Gmail toolkit](/toolkits/productivity/gmail) is what
  you want!
</Tip>

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Google auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Gmail toolkit](/toolkits/productivity/gmail), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Google services
- Your [app code](#using-google-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Google APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-google-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Google APIs

## Configuring Google auth

<Note>
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to use a [custom user verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in production.
</Note>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Google app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Google credentials in both the Arcade Cloud Platform or in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Google app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Google app.

### Create a Google app

- Follow Google's guide to [setting up OAuth credentials](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en)
- Choose the [scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) (permissions) you need for your app
- At a minimum, you must enable these scopes:
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile`
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Google app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Google Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Google app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

### Configure Google Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Google**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-google-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Google app.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Google auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Google OAuth provider. If you have multiple Google providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Google auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `google` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/google/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Google auth in app code

Use the Google auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for Google APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for Google APIs:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/google/custom_auth.py {22-26}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/google/custom_auth.js {20-22}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Google auth in custom tools

You can use the pre-built Arcade Google toolkits, like [Arcade Gmail toolkit](/toolkits/productivity/gmail), to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Google services like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and more.

If the pre-built tools in the Google toolkits don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with Google APIs.

Use the `Google()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Google. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Google token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/google/custom_tool.py {3-4,10-14,26}

```
