# Reddit auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Reddit Auth Provider. To use
  Reddit auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Reddit OAuth
  2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Reddit auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Reddit API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Reddit auth provider seamlessly manage Reddit OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Reddit auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-reddit-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Reddit APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-reddit-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Reddit APIs

## Configuring Reddit auth

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Reddit app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Reddit credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Reddit app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Reddit app.

### Create a Reddit app

- Create a Reddit Application in the [Reddit App Console](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
- Set the OAuth Redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you'll need below

Next, add the Reddit app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Reddit Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Reddit app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

### Configure Reddit Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Reddit**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-reddit-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Reddit app.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Reddit auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Reddit OAuth provider. If you have multiple Reddit providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Reddit auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

<Note>
  The Client ID is the Reddit "App key" and the Client Secret is the Reddit "App
  secret".
</Note>

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `reddit` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/reddit/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Reddit auth in app code

Use the Reddit auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Reddit API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Reddit API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/reddit/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/reddit/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Reddit auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Reddit API.

Use the `Reddit()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Reddit. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Reddit token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/reddit/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,20}

```
