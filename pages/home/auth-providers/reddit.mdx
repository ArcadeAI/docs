# Reddit auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Reddit Auth Provider. To use
  Reddit auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Reddit
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Reddit auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Reddit API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Gateway and the Reddit auth provider seamlessly manage Reddit OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Reddit auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-reddit-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Reddit APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-reddit-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Reddit APIs

## Configuring Reddit auth

### Create a Reddit app

- Create a Reddit Application in the [Reddit App Console](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
- Set the OAuth Redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you'll need below

Next, add the Reddit app to your Arcade Gateway configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring Reddit auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Reddit** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-reddit-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Reddit app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Reddit auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Gateway will automatically use this Reddit OAuth provider.

### Configuring Reddit auth in self-hosted Arcade Gateway configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

<Note>
  The Client ID is the Reddit "App key" and the Client Secret is the Reddit
  "App secret".
</Note>

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Gateway.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `reddit` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/reddit/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Reddit auth in app code

Use the Reddit auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Reddit API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Reddit API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/reddit/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/reddit/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Reddit auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Reddit API.

Use the `Reddit()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Reddit. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Reddit token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/reddit/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,20}

```
