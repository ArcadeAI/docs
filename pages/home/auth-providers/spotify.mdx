# Spotify auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Spotify Auth Provider. To use
  Spotify auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Spotify
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Spotify auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Spotify API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Spotify auth provider seamlessly manage Spotify OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Spotify auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-spotify-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Spotify APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-spotify-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Spotify APIs

## Configuring Spotify auth

<Note>
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to use a [custom user verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in production.
</Note>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Spotify app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Spotify credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Spotify app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Spotify app.

### Create a Spotify app

- Follow Spotify's guide to [registering an app](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)
- Choose the "Web API" product (at a minimum)
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Spotify app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Spotify Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Spotify app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

### Configure Spotify Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Spotify**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-spotify-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Spotify app.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Spotify auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Spotify OAuth provider. If you have multiple Spotify providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Spotify auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `spotify` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Spotify auth in app code

Use the Spotify auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Spotify API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Spotify API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Spotify auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Spotify API.

Use the `Spotify()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Spotify. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Spotify token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,19}

```
