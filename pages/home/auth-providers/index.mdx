# Auth Providers

import { ToolCard } from "@/components/ToolCard";

Auth providers enable users to seamlessly and securely allow Arcade tools to access their data.

Arcade has several auth providers available in the Arcade cloud so you don't have to configure your own.
However, using Arcade's auth providers means that your users will see the Arcade brand (name and logo) on
the auth screen and your authentications will share any rate limits from those providers with other Arcade
customers.

It can be useful to configure your own auth provider for the following reasons:

- You want to use your own brand on the auth screen
- You want to isolate your rate limits from other Arcade customers
- You want to use a provider that Arcade [does not have a built-in integration for](/home/auth-providers/oauth2)

For more information on how to customize your auth provider, select an auth provider from the list below:
