# Notion auth provider

The Notion auth provider enables tools and agents to call [Notion APIs](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro) on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Gateway and the Notion auth provider seamlessly manage Notion OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Notion auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-notion-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the Notion API
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-notion-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the Notion API

## Configuring Notion auth

How you configure the Notion auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Gateway or a [self-hosted Gateway](/home/install/overview).

With the Arcade Cloud Gateway, you can start building and testing Notion auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the Notion auth provider with your own Notion app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a Notion app

- Create a new public integration in your [integration's settings page](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations)
- Set the redirect URI to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Once you complete creating your integration, copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Notion app to your Arcade Gateway configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring Notion auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Notion** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-notion-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Notion app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Notion auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Gateway will automatically use this Notion OAuth provider.

### Configuring Notion auth in self-hosted Arcade Gateway configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export NOTION_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export NOTION_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
NOTION_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
NOTION_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Gateway.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `notion` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/notion/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Notion auth in app code

Use the Notion auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Notion API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Notion API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/notion/custom_auth.py {8-11}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/notion/custom_auth.js {8}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Notion auth in custom tools

You can use the pre-built [Arcade Notion toolkit](/toolkits/development/github/github) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Notion.

If the pre-built tools in the Notion toolkit don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Notion API.

Use the `Notion()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Notion. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Notion token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/notion/custom_tool.py {8,18}

```
