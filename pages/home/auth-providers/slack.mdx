# Slack auth provider

The Slack auth provider enables tools and agents to call [Slack APIs](https://api.slack.com/docs) on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Gateway and the Slack auth provider seamlessly manage Slack OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with Slack in your agent or AI app? The pre-built
  [Arcade Slack toolkit](/toolkits/social-communication/slack) is what you want!
</Tip>

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Slack auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Slack toolkit](/toolkits/social-communication/slack), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Slack
- Your [app code](#using-slack-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the Slack API
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-slack-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the Slack API

## Configuring Slack auth

How you configure the Slack auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Gateway or a [self-hosted Gateway](/home/install/overview).

With the Arcade Cloud Gateway, you can start building and testing Slack auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the Slack auth provider with your own Slack app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a Slack app

- Follow Slack's guide to [registering a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/quickstart)
- Choose the scopes (permissions) you need for your app
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

Next, add the Slack app to your Arcade Gateway configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring Slack auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Slack** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-slack-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Slack app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Slack auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Gateway will automatically use this Slack OAuth provider.

### Configuring Slack auth in self-hosted Arcade Gateway configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SLACK_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
SLACK_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Gateway.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `slack` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Slack auth in app code

Use the Slack auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Slack API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Slack API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/custom_auth.py {8-17}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Slack auth in custom tools

You can use the pre-built [Arcade Slack toolkit](/toolkits/social-communication/slack) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Slack.

If the pre-built tools in the Slack toolkit don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Slack API.

Use the `Slack()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Slack. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Slack token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/custom_tool.py {5-6,10-19,30}

```
