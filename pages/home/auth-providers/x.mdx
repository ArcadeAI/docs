# X auth provider

The X auth provider enables tools and agents to call the X (Twitter) API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the X auth provider seamlessly manage X OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with X services in your agent or AI app? The
  pre-built [Arcade X toolkit](/toolkits/social-communication/x) is what you
  want!
</Tip>

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure X auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade X toolkit](/toolkits/social-communication/x), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with X
- Your [app code](#using-x-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call X APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-x-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call X APIs

## Configuring X auth

How you configure the X auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

With the Arcade Cloud Engine, you can start building and testing X auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the X auth provider with your own X app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create an X app

- Follow X's guide to [creating an app](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-x-api)
- Configure user authentication for your new app and set its type to "Web app"
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

### Configuring X auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **X** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-x-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your X app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require X auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this X OAuth provider.

### Configuring X auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export X_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export X_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
X_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
X_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add an `x` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/x/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using X auth in app code

Use the X auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the X API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for X:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/x/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

## Using X auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can use the pre-built [Arcade X toolkit](/toolkits/social-communication/x) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with X.

If the pre-built tools in the X toolkit don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the X API.

Use the `X()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with X. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's X token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/x/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,21}

```
