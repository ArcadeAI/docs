# GitHub auth provider

The GitHub auth provider enables tools and agents to call [GitHub APIs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api) on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the GitHub auth provider seamlessly manage GitHub OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with GitHub in your agent or AI app? The pre-built
  [Arcade GitHub toolkit](/toolkits/development/github/github) is what you want!
</Tip>

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure GitHub auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade GitHub toolkit](/toolkits/development/github/github), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with GitHub
- Your [app code](#using-github-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the GitHub API
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-github-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the GitHub API

## Configuring GitHub auth

<Note>
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to use a [custom user verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in production.
</Note>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own GitHub app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own GitHub credentials in both the Arcade Cloud Platform or in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your GitHub app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a GitHub app.

### Create a GitHub app

- Follow GitHub's guide to [registering a GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app). Make sure to use the "GitHub App" type, which [provides more granular permissions control compared to the "OAuth App" type](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps).
- Choose the permissions you need for your app
  - At a minimum, you must enable read-only access to the Account > Email addresses permission
  - To access repo data, you must enable at least the Repository > Contents permission
- Set the redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
- Leave "Expire user authorization tokens" **checked**
- Leave "Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation" **unchecked**
- Leave "Setup URL" blank and "Redirect on update" **unchecked**
- Ensure Optional features > User-to-server token expiration is enabled
- Copy the client ID and generate a client secret to use below

If you need to access private repositories in an organization, you must also:

1. Make the app public via Advanced > Make public
2. Add the app to the organization via Install app

Next, add the GitHub app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own GitHub Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your GitHub app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure GitHub Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **GitHub**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-github-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your GitHub app.
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be added to your GitHub app's Redirect URLs.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require GitHub auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this GitHub OAuth provider. If you have multiple GitHub providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring GitHub auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `github` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/github/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using GitHub auth in app code

Use the GitHub auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the GitHub API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the GitHub API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/github/custom_auth.py {21-24}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/github/custom_auth.js {20}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using GitHub auth in custom tools

You can use the pre-built [Arcade GitHub toolkit](/toolkits/development/github/github) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with GitHub.

If the pre-built tools in the GitHub toolkit don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the GitHub API.

Use the `GitHub()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with GitHub. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's GitHub token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/github/custom_tool.py {3-4,7,15}

```
