# GitHub auth provider

The GitHub auth provider enables tools and agents to call [GitHub APIs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api) on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the GitHub auth provider seamlessly manage GitHub OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with GitHub in your agent or AI app? The pre-built
  [Arcade GitHub toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/Github/github) is what you
  want!
</Tip>

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure GitHub auth with Arcade AI.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade GitHub toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/Github/github), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with GitHub
- Your [app code](#using-github-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the GitHub API
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-github-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the GitHub API

## Configuring GitHub auth

How you configure the GitHub auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

With the Arcade Cloud Engine, you can start building and testing GitHub auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the GitHub auth provider with your own GitHub app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a GitHub app

- Follow GitHub's guide to [registering a GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app)
- Choose the permissions you need for your app
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade-ai.com/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

### Configuring GitHub auth with the Arcade Cloud Engine

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Coming soon! In 0.1.0-preview, the Arcade Cloud Engine does not yet support
  configuring auth providers.
</Warning>

### Configuring GitHub auth with a self-hosted Arcade Engine

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `github` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/github/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using GitHub auth in app code

Use the GitHub auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the GitHub API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the GitHub API:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/github/custom_auth.py {7-11}

```

## Using GitHub auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can use the pre-built [Arcade GitHub toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/Github/github) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with GitHub.

If the pre-built tools in the GitHub toolkit don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the GitHub API.

Use the `GitHub()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with GitHub. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's GitHub token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/github/custom_tool.py {3-4,7,15}

```
