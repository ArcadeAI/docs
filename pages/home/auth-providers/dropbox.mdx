# Dropbox auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Dropbox Auth Provider. To use
  Dropbox auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Dropbox
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Dropbox auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Dropbox API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Dropbox auth provider seamlessly manage Dropbox OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Dropbox auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-dropbox-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Dropbox APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-dropbox-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Dropbox APIs

## Configuring Dropbox auth

<Note>
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to use a [custom user verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in production.
</Note>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Dropbox app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Dropbox credentials in both the Arcade Cloud and in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Dropbox app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Dropbox app.

### Create a Dropbox app

- Create a Dropbox Application in the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
- In the Settings tab, under the "OAuth 2" section, set the redirect URI to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the Permissions tab, add any scopes that your app will need
- In the Settings tab, copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you'll need below

Next, add the Dropbox app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

## Configuring your own Dropbox Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Dropbox app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure Dropbox Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:9099/dashboard`. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Dropbox**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-dropbox-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Dropbox app.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Dropbox auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Dropbox OAuth provider. If you have multiple Dropbox providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Dropbox auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

<Note>
  The Client ID is the Dropbox "App key" and the Client Secret is the Dropbox
  "App secret".
</Note>

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `dropbox` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/dropbox/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Dropbox auth in app code

Use the Dropbox auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Dropbox API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Dropbox API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/dropbox/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/dropbox/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Dropbox auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Dropbox API.

Use the `Dropbox()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Dropbox. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Dropbox token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/dropbox/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,23}

```
