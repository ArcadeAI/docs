# Dropbox auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Dropbox Auth Provider. To use
  Dropbox auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Dropbox
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Dropbox auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Dropbox API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Dropbox auth provider seamlessly manage Dropbox OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Dropbox auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-dropbox-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Dropbox APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-dropbox-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Dropbox APIs

## Configuring Dropbox auth

### Create a Dropbox app

- Create a Dropbox Application in the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
- In the Settings tab, under the "OAuth 2" section, set the redirect URI to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the Permissions tab, add any scopes that your app will need
- In the Settings tab, copy the App key (Client ID) and App secret (Client Secret), which you'll need below

Next, add the Dropbox app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring Dropbox auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Dropbox** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-dropbox-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Dropbox app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Dropbox auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Dropbox OAuth provider.

### Configuring Dropbox auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

<Note>
  The Client ID is the Dropbox "App key" and the Client Secret is the Dropbox
  "App secret".
</Note>

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `dropbox` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/dropbox/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Dropbox auth in app code

Use the Dropbox auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user-scoped token for the Dropbox API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Dropbox API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/dropbox/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/dropbox/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Dropbox auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Dropbox API.

Use the `Dropbox()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Dropbox. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Dropbox token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/dropbox/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,23}

```
