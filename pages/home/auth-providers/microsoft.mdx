# Microsoft auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Microsoft Auth Provider. To use
  Microsoft auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Microsoft
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Microsoft auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Microsoft Graph API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Microsoft auth provider seamlessly manage Microsoft OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Microsoft auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-microsoft-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Microsoft Graph APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-microsoft-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Microsoft Graph APIs

## Configuring Microsoft auth

<Note>
  When using your own app credentials, make sure you configure your project to use a [custom user verifier](/home/auth/secure-auth-production#build-a-custom-user-verifier). Without this, your end-users will not be able to use your app or agent in production.
</Note>

In a production environment, you will most likely want to use your own Microsoft app credentials. This way, your users will see your application's name requesting permission.

You can use your own Microsoft credentials in both the Arcade Cloud Platform or in a [self-hosted Arcade Engine](/home/local-deployment/install/local) instance.

Before showing how to configure your Microsoft app credentials, let's go through the steps to create a Microsoft app.

### Create a Microsoft app

- Follow Microsoft's guide to [registering an app with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app)
- Choose the permissions (scopes) you need for your app. Refer to the [section below](#arcade-microsoft-toolkits-scopes) for a list of scopes needed by the Arcade Microsoft Toolkits, in case you intend to use them.
- Set the redirect URL to the redirect URL generated by Arcade (see below)
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Microsoft app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Arcade Microsoft Toolkits Scopes

Below is the list of scopes required by the Arcade Microsoft Toolkits:

| Toolkit | Required Permissions |
|---------|---------------------|
| [Outlook Calendar](/toolkits/productivity/outlook_calendar) | `Calendars.ReadBasic`<br/>`Calendars.ReadWrite`<br/>`MailboxSettings.Read` |
| [Outlook Mail](/toolkits/productivity/outlook_mail) | `Mail.Read`<br/>`Mail.ReadWrite`<br/>`Mail.Send` |
| [Teams](/toolkits/social-communication/microsoft_teams) | `Channel.ReadBasic.All`<br/>`ChannelMessage.Read.All`<br/>`ChannelMessage.Send`<br/>`Chat.Create`<br/>`Chat.Read`<br/>`ChatMessage.Read`<br/>`ChatMessage.Send`<br/>`People.Read`<br/>`Team.ReadBasic.All`<br/>`TeamMember.Read.All`<br/>`User.Read` |
| [SharePoint](/toolkits/productivity/sharepoint) | `Sites.Read.All` |

## Configuring your own Microsoft Auth Provider in Arcade

There are two ways to configure your Microsoft app credentials in Arcade:

1. From the Arcade Dashboard GUI
2. By editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted Arcade Engine)

We show both options step-by-step below.

<Tabs items={["Dashboard GUI", "Engine Configuration YAML"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Configure Microsoft Auth Using the Arcade Dashboard GUI

<Steps>

#### Access the Arcade Dashboard

To access the Arcade Cloud dashboard, go to [api.arcade.dev/dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard). If you are self-hosting, by default the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:9099/dashboard. Adjust the host and port number to match your environment.

#### Navigate to the OAuth Providers page

- Under the **OAuth** section of the Arcade Dashboard left-side menu, click **Providers**.
- Click **Add OAuth Provider** in the top right corner.
- Select the **Included Providers** tab at the top.
- In the **Provider** dropdown, select **Microsoft**.

#### Enter the provider details

- Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-microsoft-provider").
- Optionally enter a **Description**.
- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Microsoft app.
- Note the **Redirect URL** generated by Arcade. This must be set as your Microsoft app's redirect URL.

#### Create the provider

Hit the **Create** button and the provider will be ready to be used in the Arcade Engine.

</Steps>

When you use tools that require Microsoft auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Microsoft OAuth provider. If you have multiple Microsoft providers, see [using multiple auth providers of the same type](/home/auth-providers#using-multiple-providers-of-the-same-type) for more information.

### Configuring Microsoft auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `microsoft` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/microsoft/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

</Tabs.Tab>

## Using Microsoft auth in app code

Use the Microsoft auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for Microsoft Graph APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for Microsoft Graph APIs:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/microsoft/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/microsoft/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Microsoft auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with Microsoft Graph APIs.

Use the `Microsoft()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Microsoft. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Microsoft token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/microsoft/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,20}

```
