# Microsoft auth provider

The Microsoft auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Microsoft Graph API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Microsoft auth provider seamlessly manage Microsoft OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Microsoft auth with Arcade AI.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-microsoft-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Microsoft Graph APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-microsoft-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Microsoft Graph APIs

## Configuring Microsoft auth

How you configure the Microsoft auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

With the Arcade Cloud Engine, you can start building and testing Microsoft auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the Microsoft auth provider with your own Microsoft app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a Microsoft app

- Follow Microsoft's guide to [registering an app with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app)
- Choose the permissions you need for your app
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

### Configuring Microsoft auth with the Arcade Cloud Engine

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Coming soon! In 0.1.0-preview, the Arcade Cloud Engine does not yet support
  configuring auth providers.
</Warning>

### Configuring Microsoft auth with a self-hosted Arcade Engine

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `microsoft` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/microsoft/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-5}

```

</Steps>

## Using Microsoft auth in app code

Use the Microsoft auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for Microsoft Graph APIs. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for Microsoft Graph APIs:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/microsoft/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

## Using Microsoft auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with Microsoft Graph APIs.

Use the `Microsoft()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Microsoft. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Microsoft token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/microsoft/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,20}

```
