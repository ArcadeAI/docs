# Install a tool or toolkit

## PyPI Installation

All the Arcade AI-built tools and toolkits are available on PyPI. To install a tool or toolkit, run:

```bash
pip install arcade-[toolkit_name]
```

in the same environment as the arcade-ai package.

For example, to install the math tools, run:

```bash
pip install arcade-math
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
arcade show
```

which should return output similar to:

```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name         ┃ Description                  ┃ Toolkit ┃ Version ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩
│ Math.Add     │ Add two numbers together     │  Math   │  0.1.0  │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

These are all tools that are installed in the same environment as the arcade-ai package.

See our [Toolkits Integrations](/integrations/toolkits) for all available toolkits and individual installation instructions.

## Local Package Installation

Locally built toolkits can also be installed with:

```python
pip install .
```

or

```python
pip install <wheel_name>
```

in the same environment as the arcade-ai package.

## Hosted Toolkits

To add a toolkit to a hosted worker such as FastAPI, you can register them in the worker itself. This allows you to explicitly define which tools should be included on a particular worker.

```python
import arcade_math

app = FastAPI()

worker_secret = os.environ.get("ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET")
worker = FastAPIWorker(app, secret=worker_secret)

worker.register_toolkit(Toolkit.from_module(arcade_math))
```

For a full example, see the [Building a worker with FastAPI](/home/serve-tools/build-a-worker-with-fastapi)

## Showing Tools From a Hosted Engine

To show all tools that are available on an engine, you can run

```bash
arcade show -h <engine_host> -p <engine_port>
```

```

## Authenticated Tools

Some Toolkits may need authentication through an API key or OAuth, which can be configured in the Arcade Engine. To see the specific configuration requirements, you can checkout our [OAuth Providers](/integrations/auth) or see required authentication provider in the [Toolkit Description](/integrations/toolkits/Github/github) of each tool.
