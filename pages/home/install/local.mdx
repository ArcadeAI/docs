# Installing Arcade Locally

This guide will help you install Arcade and set up your development environment. If you are developing tools to use with Arcade, this guide will provide you with a complete local deployment of Arcade for developing and testing tools.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **pip**: The Python package installer should be available. It's typically included with Python.
- **Arcade Account**: Sign up for an [Arcade account](https://account.arcade.dev/register?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.arcade.dev%2Fdashboard%2Fwelcome) if you haven't already.
- **Package Manager**: Either Brew (macOS) or Apt (linux) to install the engine binary.

Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.

## Installation

<Steps>
### Install the Client
To connect to the cloud or local Arcade Engine, we need to install the Arcade SDK and CLI from the `arcade-ai` package.

```bash
pip install 'arcade-ai[fastapi,evals]'
arcade login
```

### Install the Engine

To run the Arcade Engine locally, you need to install `arcade-engine`. Choose the installation method that matches your operating system.

This will install a template engine configuration.

<Tabs items={['macOS (Homebrew)', 'Ubuntu/Debian (APT)', 'Other Operating Systems']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash
  brew install ArcadeAI/tap/arcade-engine
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash
  wget -qO - https://deb.arcade.dev/public-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  echo "deb https://deb.arcade.dev/ubuntu stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/arcade-ai.list
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install arcade-engine
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  For other operating systems, download the appropriate binary from the [Arcade Releases](https://arcade.dev/releases) page and add it to your system's `PATH`.
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Install a toolkit

In order to run the Arcade worker, you need to install a tool. For local development, you can just `pip install` a tool in the same environment as the client.

```bash
pip install arcade-math
```

For more information on installing toolkits, see the [Toolkit Installation](/home/install/toolkits) page.

To see all available toolkits, view the [Toolkits Page](/toolkits).

### Set OpenAI API key

Before starting the Engine, we need to set an OpenAI API Key that the Engine can use to connect to OpenAI.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your_openai_api_key>"
```

To make the API key persistent or to change other configurations, see the [Configuration Overview](/home/configure/overview).

### Start the Engine and worker

To run both the engine and a local worker, use:

```bash
arcade dev
```

The Engine and worker should both be running locally now.

To run the Engine on it's own, you can run:

```bash
arcade-engine
```

Note that the Engine requires connection to at least one Arcade worker to run. `arcade dev` starts both the Engine and worker automatically.

### Connect

To chat with the running Engine, in a separate terminal instance, run:

```bash
arcade chat -h localhost
```

You are now chatting with Arcade locally! To see an example of chatting, view the [quickstart](/home/quickstart).

</Steps>

## Next Steps

- **Building Tools**: Learn how to build tools with your local Arcade Instance in the [Creating a Toolkit](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) guide.
- **Hosting With Docker**: Learn how to run the [Engine in Docker](/home/install/docker).

## Troubleshooting

### Engine Binary Not Found

```bash
❌ Engine binary not found
```

or

```bash
command not found: arcade-engine
```

This means that the Arcade Engine cannot be found in your path. Brew and Apt will automatically add the binary to you path.

Check that the binary has been properly installed (These are the common installation locations):

**Brew**

```bash
ls $HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY/Cellar/arcade-engine/<version>/bin/arcade-engine
```

**Apt**

```bash
ls /usr/bin/arcade-engine
```

If the binary is found, add it to your path with:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/binary
```

<br />

### Toolkits Not Found

```bash
No toolkits found in Python environment. Exiting...
```

This means that there are no toolkits found in the same environment as the Arcade SDK. Ensure that you are installing the toolkit package in the same environment and see the [Toolkit Installation Guide](/home/install/toolkits) for more details.

<br />

### Engine Config Not Found

```bash
❌ Config file 'engine.yaml' not found in any of the default locations.
```

or

```bash
Arcade Engine has finished with error: unable to read config file $HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml: open $HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml: no such file or directory
```

`arcade dev` will search for the engine config in known directories including:

- $HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml
- $HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY/etc/arcade-engine/engine.yaml (Homebrew)
- /etc/arcade-ai/engine.yaml (Apt)

The engine config will be downloaded by and added to one of these locations when installing the engine.

When running the engine without `arcade dev`, the config needs to be in the `$HOME/.arcade/` directory or explicitly located with `arcade-engine -c /path/to/engine.yaml`

If you cannot find your engine config, you can save and use the [Configuration Templates](/home/configure/templates).
