## Installing Arcade AI Locally

This guide will help you install Arcade AI and set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **pip**: The Python package installer should be available. It's typically included with Python.
- **Arcade AI Account**: Sign up for an [Arcade AI account](https://arcade-ai.com/signup) if you haven't already.

Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.

## <br />

<br />

### Install `arcade-ai`

Install the Arcade AI SDK and CLI using `pip`. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install arcade-ai[fastapi,evals]
```

This command installs the Arcade AI library along with optional dependencies for FastAPI and the evaluation framework.

#### Verify the Installation

After installation, check that the `arcade` CLI is available by running:

```bash
arcade
```

You should see the help text for the Arcade AI CLI, confirming that the installation was successful.

#### Log In

Login to Arcade to fetch your API Key.

```bash
arcade login
```

Your browser should open to the sign-on portal. Once you sign in you can close the browser and return to the CLI.

## <br />

<br />

### Install the Arcade AI Engine

To run the Arcade AI engine locally, you need to install the `arcade-engine`. Choose the installation method that matches your operating system.

#### macOS (Homebrew)

If you're using macOS, install the Arcade AI Engine using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install arcade-ai/arcade/arcade-engine
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian (APT)

For Ubuntu or Debian systems, add the Arcade AI repository and install via APT:

```bash
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.arcade-ai.com/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/arcade-ai.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install arcade-engine
```

### Other Operating Systems

For other operating systems, download the appropriate binary from the [Arcade AI Releases](https://arcade-ai.com/releases) page and add it to your system's `PATH`.

### Running Arcade Locally

When developing tools and toolkits for Arcade AI, you need to be able to run your own instance of Arcade AI locally.

To run Arcade AI locally, you need to

1. Install a tool or toolkit to serve (in a python env)
2. Start an Actor serving that tool or toolkit (in the same python env)
3. Start the Arcade AI Engine configured with the Actor HTTP address

the `arcade dev` command is provided that provides a single command for steps 2 and 3.

#### Install a tool or toolkit

All the Arcade AI-built tools and toolkits are available on PyPI. To install a tool or toolkit, run:

```bash
pip install arcade-[toolkit_name]
```

For example, to install the web search tools, run:

```bash
pip install arcade-search
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
arcade show
```

which should return output similar to:

```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name         ┃ Description                  ┃ Toolkit ┃ Version ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩
│ SearchGoogle │ Search Google using SerpAPI  │ search  │ 0.1.0   │
│              │ and return organic search    │         │         │
│              │ results.                     │         │         │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

#### Start Arcade AI for local development

Before starting the engine, make sure it's in your path:

```bash
which arcade-engine
```

This should return the path to the `arcade-engine` executable.

If it's not in your path, add it:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/arcade-engine
```

With the engine installed, you can start it using the `arcade dev` command:

```bash
arcade dev -c engine-config.yaml -e .env
```

This command starts the Arcade AI engine and an Actor which will serve the toolkits installed in the current python environment.

You should see output similar to:

```
Starting actor server...
Actor> INFO | Serving the following toolkits:
Actor> INFO |   - your_toolkit (arcade_your_toolkit): 1 tools
Actor> INFO | Starting FastAPI server...
Actor> INFO | Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8002 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Starting engine...
Engine> INFO | Arcade Engine is starting...
Engine> INFO | Getting tool definitions from actor
Engine> INFO | Server running on http://0.0.0.0:9099
```

<Note>
  The `arcade dev` command is a convenience command that starts the engine and
  actor and should not be used in production.
</Note>

### Use `arcade chat` to test your setup

With the engine running, you can test your setup by starting a chat session:

```bash
arcade chat
```

If you're configured correctly and running the local engine, you should see:

```
> arcade chat

=== Arcade AI Chat ===

Chatting with Arcade Engine at http://0.0.0.0:9099/v1
```

If you're using the cloud engine, you should see:

```
> arcade chat

=== Arcade AI Chat ===

Chatting with Arcade Engine at https://api.arcade-ai.com/v1
```

To use your local engine, you need to configure the Arcade AI CLI to point to the local engine or wherever it's hosted.

#### Configure for local engine

By default, the Arcade AI CLI is configured to use the Arcade AI Cloud Engine. If you want to use your local engine, update your configuration:

```bash
arcade config edit --key engine.host --val localhost
arcade config edit --key engine.port --val 9099
arcade config edit --key engine.tls --val False
```

Verify your configuration:

```bash
arcade config
```

You should see output similar to:

```
