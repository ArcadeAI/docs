# Installing Arcade AI Locally

This guide will help you install Arcade AI and set up your development environment.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **pip**: The Python package installer should be available. It's typically included with Python.
- **Arcade AI Account**: Sign up for an [Arcade AI account](https://arcade-ai.com/signup) if you haven't already.
- **Package Manager**: Either Brew (macOS) or Apt (linux) to install the engine binary.

Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.

## Installation

<Steps>
### Install the client
To connect to the cloud or local engine, we need to install the ArcadeAI Client.

```bash
pip install 'arcade-ai[fastapi,evals]'
arcade login
```
For a simple example on using the client, see the [quickstart](/home/quickstart)


### Install the Engine
To run the Arcade AI engine locally, you need to install the `arcade-engine`. Choose the installation method that matches your operating system.

This will install a template engine configuration and environment file.

#### macOS (Homebrew)

If you're using macOS, install the Arcade AI Engine using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ArcadeAI/tap/arcade-engine
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian (APT)

For Ubuntu or Debian systems, add the Arcade AI repository and install via APT:

```bash
wget -qO - https://deb.arcade-ai.com/public-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://deb.arcade-ai.com/ubuntu stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/arcade-ai.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install arcade-engine
```

#### Other Operating Systems

For other operating systems, download the appropriate binary from the [Arcade AI Releases](https://arcade-ai.com/releases) page and add it to your system's `PATH`.

### Install a toolkit
In order to run the arcade actor, we need to install a tool. For local development, we can just pip install a tool in the same environment as the client.
```bash
pip install arcade-math
```

For more information on installing toolkits, see the [Toolkit Installation](/home/install/toolkits) page

### Start the Engine and Actor
To run both the engine and a local actor, use:
```bash
arcade dev
```
To run the Engine on it's own, you can run:
```bash
arcade-engine
```

### Connect
To chat with the running engine, you can run:
```bash
arcade chat -h localhost -p 9099
```
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Engine Binary Not Found
If you see a message that says:

```bash
❌ Engine binary not found
```
or
```bash
command not found: arcade-engine
```

### Toolkits Not Found
```bash
No toolkits found in Python environment. Exiting...
```

### Engine Config Not Found
```bash
❌ Config file 'engine.yaml' not found in any of the default locations.
```

```bash
Arcade Engine has finished with error: unable to read config file $HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml: open $HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml: no such file or directory
```
