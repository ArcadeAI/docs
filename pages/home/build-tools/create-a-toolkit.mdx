# Creating a Toolkit

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a custom toolkit for Arcade AI.

You'll create a simple arithmetic toolkit with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- Follow the [Set up Arcade AI Locally](/home/install/local) guide to install Arcade AI and the SDK.

### Create a new toolkit

Run the following command to start creating your toolkit:

```bash
arcade new
```

Arcade AI will prompt you to enter a name and other details for your toolkit. After you provide the information, a skeleton toolkit will be generated for you.

### Define your tools

Create a Python file for your tools, e.g., `arithmetic.py`, in the `arcade_<toolkit_name>/tools` directory of your new toolkit and import the necessary modules:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from arcade.sdk import tool
```

Now, define your tools using the `@tool` decorator:

```python
@tool
def add(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The sum of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Add two numbers together
    """
    return a + b

@tool
def subtract(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The difference of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Subtract two numbers
    """
    return a - b

@tool
def multiply(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The product of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Multiply two numbers together
    """
    return a * b

@tool
def divide(
    a: Annotated[int, "The numerator"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The denominator"]
) -> Annotated[float, "The quotient of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Divide two numbers
    """
    return a / b
```

### Register your tools

To register your tools locally, use the `make install` command provided in the Makefile created by `arcade new`. This will install the toolkit locally.

Navigate to the directory created by `arcade new` (with the `pyproject.toml` file) and run:

```bash
make install
```

This will load the tool into the local worker environment.

You can run the Engine and Worker to test your new tool with:


```bash
arcade dev
```

Additionally, the Makefile includes other helpful commands such as:

- `make check`: Runs all pre-commit checks that must pass.
- `make test`: Runs all unit tests in the toolkit's `test` directory.

<Warning>
  See the [Local Installation Guide](/home/install/local) for setting up `arcade
  dev` if you have not done so already.{" "}
</Warning>

### Use your tools with Arcade

Now that your local Engine and Actor are running via the `arcade dev` command, you can use your custom tools with Arcade AI in your application.

Here's an example of how to use your tools:

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(base_url="http://localhost:9099")

# Use the tools in a chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is 6 times 7?"}],
    model="gpt-4o",
    tool_choice="generate",
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

</Steps>

### How it works

By decorating your functions with `@tool`, you expose them to the Arcade AI platform.

The `Annotated` types and docstrings provide metadata that helps the AI understand how to use your tools.

### Next steps

Try adding more tools to your toolkit, such as `sqrt`, `sum_list`, or `sum_range`.

Explore advanced features like tool [authorization](/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-auth) and [evaluation](/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools) to enhance your tools.
