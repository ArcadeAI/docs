# Creating a Toolkit

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a custom toolkit for Arcade AI.

You'll create a simple arithmetic toolkit with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade AI Locally](/home/install/local)
- Install the Arcade SDK:

```bash
pip install arcade-ai
```

### Create a new toolkit

Use `arcade new` to create a new toolkit:

```bash
arcade new
```

### Define your tools

Create a Python file for your tools, e.g., `arithmetic.py`, and import the necessary modules:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from arcade.sdk import tool
```

Now, define your tools using the `@tool` decorator:

```python
@tool
def add(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The sum of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Add two numbers together
    """
    return a + b

@tool
def subtract(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The difference of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Subtract two numbers
    """
    return a - b

@tool
def multiply(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The product of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Multiply two numbers together
    """
    return a * b

@tool
def divide(
    a: Annotated[int, "The numerator"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The denominator"]
) -> Annotated[float, "The quotient of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Divide two numbers
    """
    return a / b
```

### Register your tools

To register your tools locally, you can run pip install them and test them in `arcade dev`

In the tool directory with the `pyproject.toml`, run:
```bash
pip install .
```

This will load the tool into the local actor environment.

You can now run:
```bash
arcade dev
```

To start the Engine and Actor with your new tool.

<Warning>See the [Local Installation Guide](/home/install/local) for setting up `arcade dev` if you have not done so already. </Warning>


### Use your tools with Arcade

Now you can use your custom tools with Arcade AI in your application.

Here's an example of how to use your tools:

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(api_key="your_api_key", base_url="localhost:9099")

# Use the tools in a chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is 6 times 7?"}],
    model="gpt-4o",
    tool_choice="auto",
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

</Steps>

### How it works

By decorating your functions with `@tool`, you expose them to the Arcade AI platform.

The `Annotated` types and docstrings provide metadata that helps the AI understand how to use your tools.

The `ToolCatalog` collects your tools and makes them available to the AI assistant.

### Next steps

Try adding more tools to your toolkit, such as `sqrt`, `sum_list`, or `sum_range`.

Explore advanced features like tool authorization and evaluation to enhance your tools.
