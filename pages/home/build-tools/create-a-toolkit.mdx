# Creating a Toolkit

This guide walks you through the complete process of creating a custom toolkit for Arcade - from initial setup to publishing on PyPI. You'll build a simple arithmetic toolkit with operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- An [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=custom-tools)
- An active virtual environment for your shell(s) (e.g. `uv venv --seed -p 3.13`)
    - We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/) or [miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main).
    - Toolkits each have a poetry project with their own virtual environment, but toolkits are loaded into the top-level arcade environment based on the active  "parent" virtual environment.  **The local development commands will not work without an active virtual environment.**
- `pip` installed within that virtual environment (verify with `pip --version`)
- Arcade CLI installed within your python virtual environment: `pip install arcade-ai`
- Poetry for package management (the generated Makefile uses Poetry): `pip install poetry`

<Steps>

### Generate a toolkit template

Run the following command to start creating your toolkit:

```bash
git init
arcade new
```

Enter the required information when prompted:
- **Toolkit name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "arithmetic")
- **Description**: Provide a brief explanation of your toolkit
- **Author name and email**: Your contact information

After completion, a directory with your toolkit name will be created with the following structure:

```
arithmetic/
├── arcade_arithmetic/       # Core package directory
│   ├── __init__.py          # Package initialization
│   └── tools/               # Directory for your tools
│       └── __init__.py
├── tests/                   # Test directory
├── pyproject.toml           # Poetry project configuration
├── README.md                # Documentation
└── Makefile                 # Helper commands
```

Navigate to your toolkit directory:

```bash
cd <toolkit_name>
```

### Set up the development environment

Install dependencies and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
make install
```

This installs all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`, pre-commit hooks for code quality, and your toolkit in development mode.

The Makefile provides several helpful commands:
- `build` - Build wheel file using poetry
- `bump-version` - Bump the version in pyproject.toml
- `check` - Run code quality tools
- `clean-build` - Clean build artifacts
- `coverage` - Generate coverage report
- `install` - Install the poetry environment and pre-commit hooks
- `test` - Test the code with pytest

### Define your tools

Create a Python file for your tools in the `arcade_<toolkit_name>/tools` directory.

The following example shows a simple math toolkit with three tools: `add`, `subtract`, and `multiply`:

```python
# arcade_arithmetic/tools/operations.py
from typing import Annotated

from arcade.sdk import tool


@tool
def add(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The sum of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Add two numbers together

    Examples:
        add(3, 4) -> 7
        add(-1, 5) -> 4
    """
    return a + b

@tool
def subtract(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The difference of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Subtract the second number from the first

    Examples:
        subtract(10, 4) -> 6
        subtract(5, 7) -> -2
    """
    return a - b

@tool
def multiply(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The product of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Multiply two numbers together

    Examples:
        multiply(3, 4) -> 12
        multiply(-2, 5) -> -10
    """
    return a * b
```

Update the package initialization files to expose your tools:

```python
# arcade_arithmetic/tools/__init__.py
from .operations import add, multiply, subtract

__all__ = ["add", "multiply", "subtract"]
```

```python
# arcade_arithmetic/__init__.py
from arcade_arithmetic.tools import add, multiply, subtract

__all__ = ["add", "multiply", "subtract"]
```

### Test your toolkit

Write tests for your tools in the `tests` directory:

```python
# tests/test_operations.py
import pytest

from arcade_arithmetic.tools.operations import add, multiply, subtract


def test_add():
    assert add(3, 4) == 7
    assert add(-1, 5) == 4
    assert add(0, 0) == 0

def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(10, 4) == 6
    assert subtract(5, 7) == -2
    assert subtract(0, 0) == 0

def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(3, 4) == 12
    assert multiply(-2, 5) == -10
    assert multiply(0, 5) == 0
```

Run the tests:

```bash
make test
```

Check code quality:

```bash
make check
```

Generate a coverage report (optional):

```bash
make coverage
```

### Verify local installation

Your toolkit should already be installed locally from the `make install` command. Verify it's properly registered:

```bash
arcade show --local
```

You should see your toolkit listed in the output.

### Test your tools locally

Serve your toolkit locally with the Arcade CLI:

```bash
arcade serve
```

Visit http://localhost:8002/worker/health to see that your worker is running.

### Connect your local toolkit to Arcade Gateway

In another terminal, use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/), [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel), or [cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/create-local-tunnel/) to give your local worker a public URL.

```bash
ngrok http 8002
```

```bash
tailscale funnel 8002
```

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8002
```

Then in your Arcade dashboard:

1. Navigate to the [Workers](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/workers) page.
1. Click **Add Worker**.
1. Fill in the form with the following values:
    - **ID**: `my-arithmetic-worker`
    - **Worker Type**: `Arcade`
    - **URL**: your public URL from ngrok, tailscale, or cloudflare
    - **Secret**: `dev`
    - **Timeout** and **Retry**: can be left at default values
1. Click **Create**.

Now, in the [Playground](https://api.arcade.dev/playground/execute), you can see your tools in action.

### Deploy your toolkit to Arcade

Alternatively, you can deploy your toolkit to Arcade's cloud instead of tunneling to it locally.

Find the `worker.toml` file in your toolkit's root directory (where you ran `arcade new`):

```toml
[[worker]]

[worker.config]
id = "demo-worker"  # Choose a unique ID
enabled = true
timeout = 30
retries = 3
secret = "<your-secret>"  # This is randomly generated for you by `arcade new`
[worker.local_source]
packages = ["./arithmetic"]  # Path to your toolkit directory
```

From the root of your toolkit, deploy your toolkit to Arcade's cloud with:

```bash
arcade deploy
```

Verify the deployment:

```bash
arcade worker list
```

### Package and publish to PyPI

Clean any previous build artifacts:

```bash
make clean-build
```

If you're updating an existing package, bump the version:


```bash
make bump-version
```

Update the project metadata in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "arcade-arithmetic"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Basic arithmetic operations toolkit for Arcade"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
readme = "README.md"
license = "MIT"
repository = "https://github.com/yourusername/arcade-arithmetic"
```

Create a comprehensive README.md file that explains your toolkit's purpose, installation, and usage.

Build your package:

```bash
make build
```

Configure Poetry with your PyPI token (recommended for security):

```bash
poetry config pypi-token.pypi your-token-here
```

Publish to PyPI:

```bash
poetry publish
```

Or build and publish in one step:

```bash
poetry publish --build
```

</Steps>

## Using your published toolkit

Now that your toolkit is published, you can use it in any Arcade application:

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

# Initialize the Arcade client
client = Arcade(base_url="https://api.arcade.dev")

# Create a chat completion that can use your tools
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant with arithmetic skills."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Calculate 12 + 34 and then multiply by 2"}
    ],
    model="gpt-4o",
    tool_choice="generate",
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Ongoing toolkit maintenance

As you continue to develop your toolkit, use these Makefile commands to maintain it:

- `make check` - Run code quality checks before committing changes
- `make test` - Run tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
- `make coverage` - Monitor test coverage as you add new features
- `make bump-version` - Update the version when releasing new changes
- `make build` - Build new distribution packages
- `make clean-build` - Clean up build artifacts when needed
