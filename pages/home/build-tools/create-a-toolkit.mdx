# Creating a Toolkit

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a custom toolkit for Arcade.

You'll create a simple arithmetic toolkit with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade](/home/quickstart)

### Create a new toolkit

Run the following command to start creating your toolkit:

```bash
arcade new
```

Arcade will prompt you to enter a name and other details for your toolkit. After you provide the information, a skeleton toolkit will be generated for you in a directory named with the toolkit name that you entered.

```bash
cd <toolkit_name>
```

### Define your tools

Create a Python file for your tools, e.g., `arithmetic.py`, in the `arcade_<toolkit_name>/tools` directory of your new toolkit and import the necessary modules:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from arcade.sdk import tool
```

Now, define your tools using the `@tool` decorator:

```python
@tool
def add(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The sum of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Add two numbers together
    """
    return a + b

@tool
def subtract(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The difference of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Subtract two numbers
    """
    return a - b

@tool
def multiply(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The product of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Multiply two numbers together
    """
    return a * b

@tool
def divide(
    a: Annotated[int, "The numerator"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The denominator"]
) -> Annotated[float, "The quotient of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Divide two numbers
    """
    return a / b
```

### Register your tools

To register your tools locally, use the `make install` command provided in the Makefile created by `arcade new`. This will install the toolkit locally.

Navigate to the directory created by `arcade new` (with the `pyproject.toml` file) and run:

```bash
make install
```

This will load the tool into the local worker environment.


you can then run ``arcade show --local`` to see your tool in the local worker environment.


You can run the Worker, which serves tools, to test your new tool with:


```bash
arcade serve
```

Then you can visit http://localhost:8002/docs to see your tools served by the worker.

Additionally, the Makefile includes other helpful commands such as:

- `make check`: Runs all pre-commit checks that must pass.
- `make test`: Runs all unit tests in the toolkit's `test` directory.


### Deploy your toolkit



## Requirements

- **Python 3.10** or higher <br/> Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
- **Arcade Account**: Sign up for an <SignupLink utmParams={{
            utm_source: "docs",
            utm_medium: "page",
            utm_campaign: "custom-tools",
          }} linkLocation="docs:custom-tools">Arcade account</SignupLink> if you haven't already.
- **Arcade CLI**: Install the Arcade CLI with `pip install arcade-ai`.

<Steps>

## Create your deployment config

Create a `worker.toml` file in your project directory if there is not one already.

```yaml
### Worker 1
[[worker]]

[worker.config]
id = "my-worker"
secret = <your secret> # Replace with your own secret

[worker.local_source]
packages = ["./myToolkit"] # Replace with the path to your toolkit directory
```
<Note>
  For more information on the `worker.toml` file, see the [Arcade Deploy documentation](/home/configure/arcade-deploy).
</Note>
---

## Deploy your worker

Run the deploy command in the directory containing your `worker.toml` file:

```bash
arcade deploy
```

You should see output like the following:
```bash
Deploying 'my-worker...'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 main.py:589

✅ Worker 'my-worker' deployed successfully.
```

---

## List your workers

Run the following command to list your workers:

```bash
arcade worker list
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash
                                                     Workers

┡━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩

└───────────┴────────────────┴───────────────────┴─────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────┘
```


Your worker and toolkits are now deployed and registered with the engine and ready to use!

You can go to the [dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/workers) to see your worker and its details.


## Use your tools with Arcade Hosted in the Cloud

Here's an example of how to use your tools:

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade(base_url="https://api.arcade.dev")

# Use the tools in a chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is 6 times 7?"}],
    model="gpt-4o",
    tool_choice="generate",
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

</Steps>

### How it works

By decorating your functions with `@tool`, you expose them to the Arcade platform.

The `Annotated` types and docstrings provide metadata that helps the AI understand how to use your tools.

### Next steps

Try adding more tools to your toolkit, such as `sqrt`, `sum_list`, or `sum_range`.

Explore advanced features like tool [authorization](/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-auth) and [evaluation](/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools) to enhance your tools.
