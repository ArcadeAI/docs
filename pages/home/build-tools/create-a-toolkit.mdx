# Creating a Toolkit

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-[4fr_3fr] gap-8">
  <div>
    This guide walks you through the complete process of creating a custom toolkit for Arcade - from initial setup to publishing on PyPI. You'll build a simple arithmetic toolkit with operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  When creating or extending an Arcade toolkit, we make it easy to develop the tool alongside your agent, providing a pleasant local development experience.  As your agent will be loading its available tools from the Arcade Engine, you can mix existing tools and your locally developed tool by following this guide.  You'll be running your local worker with the Arcade CLI and registering it with the Engine so that your agent can find and use your tool.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- An [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=custom-tools)
- An active virtual environment for your shell(s) (e.g. `uv venv --seed -p 3.13`)
    - We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/) or [miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main).
    - Toolkits each have a poetry project with their own virtual environment, but toolkits are loaded into the top-level arcade environment based on the active  "parent" virtual environment.  **The local development commands will not work without an active virtual environment.**
- `pip` installed within that virtual environment (verify with `pip --version`)
- Arcade CLI installed within your python virtual environment: `pip install arcade-ai`
- Poetry for package management (the generated Makefile uses Poetry): `pip install poetry`

<Steps>

## Generate a toolkit template

Run the following command to start creating your toolkit:

```bash
git init
arcade new
```

Enter the required information when prompted:
- **Toolkit name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "arithmetic")
- **Description**: Provide a brief explanation of your toolkit
- **Author name and email**: Your contact information

After completion, a directory with your toolkit name will be created with the following structure:

```
arithmetic/
├── arcade_arithmetic/       # Core package directory
│   ├── __init__.py          # Package initialization
│   └── tools/               # Directory for your tools
│       └── __init__.py
├── tests/                   # Test directory
├── pyproject.toml           # Poetry project configuration
├── README.md                # Documentation
└── Makefile                 # Helper commands
```

Navigate to your toolkit directory:

```bash
cd <toolkit_name>
```

## Set up the development environment

Install dependencies and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
make install
```

This installs all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`, pre-commit hooks for code quality, and your toolkit in development mode.

The Makefile provides several helpful commands:
- `build` - Build wheel file using poetry
- `bump-version` - Bump the version in pyproject.toml
- `check` - Run code quality tools
- `clean-build` - Clean build artifacts
- `coverage` - Generate coverage report
- `install` - Install the poetry environment and pre-commit hooks
- `test` - Test the code with pytest


Activate the environment with:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

or

```bash
uv run
```

## Define your tools

Create a Python file for your tools in the `arcade_<toolkit_name>/tools` directory.

The following example shows a simple math toolkit with three tools: `add`, `subtract`, and `multiply`:

```python
# arcade_arithmetic/tools/operations.py
from typing import Annotated

from arcade.sdk import tool


@tool
def add(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The sum of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Add two numbers together

    Examples:
        add(3, 4) -> 7
        add(-1, 5) -> 4
    """
    return a + b

@tool
def subtract(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The difference of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Subtract the second number from the first

    Examples:
        subtract(10, 4) -> 6
        subtract(5, 7) -> -2
    """
    return a - b

@tool
def multiply(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The product of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Multiply two numbers together

    Examples:
        multiply(3, 4) -> 12
        multiply(-2, 5) -> -10
    """
    return a * b
```

Update the package initialization files to expose your tools:

```python
# arcade_arithmetic/tools/__init__.py
from .operations import add, multiply, subtract

__all__ = ["add", "multiply", "subtract"]
```

```python
# arcade_arithmetic/__init__.py
from arcade_arithmetic.tools import add, multiply, subtract

__all__ = ["add", "multiply", "subtract"]
```

## Test your toolkit

Write tests for your tools in the `tests` directory:

```python
# tests/test_operations.py
import pytest

from arcade_arithmetic.tools.operations import add, multiply, subtract


def test_add():
    assert add(3, 4) == 7
    assert add(-1, 5) == 4
    assert add(0, 0) == 0

def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(10, 4) == 6
    assert subtract(5, 7) == -2
    assert subtract(0, 0) == 0

def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(3, 4) == 12
    assert multiply(-2, 5) == -10
    assert multiply(0, 5) == 0
```

Run the tests:

```bash
make test
```

Check code quality:

```bash
make check
```

Generate a coverage report (optional):

```bash
make coverage
```

## Verify local installation

Your toolkit should already be installed locally from the `make install` command. Verify it's properly registered:

```bash
arcade show --local
```

You should see your toolkit listed in the output.

## Test your tools locally

Serve your toolkit locally with the Arcade CLI:

```bash
arcade serve
```

You can use the `--reload` flag to automatically reload the server when you make changes to your toolkit:

```bash
arcade serve --reload
```

Visit http://localhost:8002/worker/health to see that your worker is running.

## Connect your toolkit to the Arcade Engine

In another terminal, use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/), [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel), or [cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/create-local-tunnel/) to give your local worker a public URL.

<Tabs items={["ngrok", "Tailscale", "Cloudflare"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```bash
ngrok http 8002
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```bash
tailscale funnel 8002
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8002
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

Then in your Arcade dashboard:

1. Navigate to the [Workers](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/workers) page.
1. Click **Add Worker**.
1. Fill in the form with the following values:
    - **ID**: `my-arithmetic-worker`
    - **Worker Type**: `Arcade`
    - **URL**: your public URL from ngrok, tailscale, or cloudflare
    - **Secret**: `dev`
    - **Timeout** and **Retry**: can be left at default values
1. Click **Create**.

Now, in the [Playground](https://api.arcade.dev/playground/execute), you can see your tools in action.

## Deploy your toolkit to the Arcade Engine

Alternatively, you can deploy your toolkit to Arcade's cloud instead of tunneling to it locally.

Find the `worker.toml` file in your toolkit's root directory (where you ran `arcade new`):

```toml
[[worker]]

[worker.config]
id = "demo-worker"  # Choose a unique ID
enabled = true
timeout = 30
retries = 3
secret = "<your-secret>"  # This is randomly generated for you by `arcade new`
[worker.local_source]
packages = ["./arithmetic"]  # Path to your toolkit directory
```
See [Configuring Arcade Deploy](/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy) for more configuration options.

From the root of your toolkit, deploy your toolkit to Arcade's cloud with:

```bash
arcade deploy
```

Verify the deployment:

```bash
arcade worker list
```

## Package and publish to PyPI

Clean any previous build artifacts:

```bash
make clean-build
```

If you're updating an existing package, bump the version:


```bash
make bump-version
```

Update the project metadata in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "arcade-arithmetic"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Basic arithmetic operations toolkit for Arcade"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
readme = "README.md"
license = "MIT"
repository = "https://github.com/yourusername/arcade-arithmetic"
```

Create a comprehensive README.md file that explains your toolkit's purpose, installation, and usage.

Build your package:

```bash
make build
```

Configure Poetry with your PyPI token (recommended for security):

```bash
poetry config pypi-token.pypi your-token-here
```

Publish to PyPI:

```bash
poetry publish
```

Or build and publish in one step:

```bash
poetry publish --build
```

</Steps>

## Using your published toolkit

Now that your toolkit is published, you can use it in any Arcade application:

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade

# Initialize the Arcade client
client = Arcade(base_url="https://api.arcade.dev")

# Use your Tools
response = client.tools.execute(
    tool_name="Arithmetic.Add",
    input={
        "a": 12,
        "b": 34
    },
)

print(response.output.value)
```

## Ongoing toolkit maintenance

As you continue to develop your toolkit, use these Makefile commands to maintain it:

- `make check` - Run code quality checks before committing changes
- `make test` - Run tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
- `make coverage` - Monitor test coverage as you add new features
- `make bump-version` - Update the version when releasing new changes
- `make build` - Build new distribution packages
- `make clean-build` - Clean up build artifacts when needed
