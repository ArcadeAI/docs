# Tool errors in Arcade AI

When working with Arcade AI's Tool SDK, you may encounter various types of errors. This guide will help you understand and handle these errors effectively.

## Handling errors in your tools

In most cases, you don't need to raise errors explicitly in your tools. The `@tool` decorator takes care of proper error propagation and handling. When an unexpected error occurs during tool execution, Arcade AI's `ToolExecutor` and `@tool` decorator will raise a `ToolExecutionError` with the necessary context and traceback information.

However, if you want to retry the tool call with additional content to improve the tool call's input parameters, you can raise a [RetryableToolError](/home/build-tools/retry-tools-with-improved-prompt) within the tool.

## Common error scenarios

Let's explore some common error scenarios you might encounter:

### 1. Output type mismatch

This occurs when the expected output type of a tool does not match the actual output type when executed.

```json
{
  "name": "tool_call_error",
  "message": "tool call failed - Example.Hello failed: Failed to
  serialize tool output"
}
```

For example, the following tool will raise the above error because the tool's definition specifies that the output should be a string, but the tool returns a list:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from arcade.sdk import tool

@tool
def hello(name: Annotated[str, "The name of the friend to greet"]) -> str:
  """
  Says hello to a friend
  """
  return ["hello", name]
```

### 2. Input parameter type error

This occurs when the input parameter of a tool is of an unsupported type.

```
Type error encountered while adding tool list_org_repositories from
arcade_github.tools.repositories. Reason: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class
```

For example, the following tool will raise the above error because the tool input parameter is of an unsupported type:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from arcade.sdk import tool

@tool
def hello(names: Annotated[tuple[str, str, str], "The names of the friends to greet"]) -> str:
  """
  Says hello to a list of friends
  """
  return f"Hello, {names[0]}, {names[1]}, and {names[2]}!"
```

### 3. Unexpected HTTP error during tool execution

This occurs when the tool makes an HTTP request and receives a non-2xx response. Specifically for the example below, the authenticated user did not have permission to access the private organization's repositories.

```json
{
  "name": "tool_call_error",
  "message": "tool call failed - Github.ListOrgRepositories failed: Error accessing 'https://api.github.com/orgs/a-private-org/repos': Failed to process request. Status code: 401"
}
```
