# Adding user authorization to your tools

In this guide, you'll learn how to add user authorization to your custom tools, using Arcade AI.

You'll create a tool that sends a message on behalf of a user via Slack.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade AI](/home/quickstart)
- Install the Arcade SDK and any third-party SDKs you need (e.g., Slack SDK):
- [Understand Tool Context](/home/build-tools/tool-context)

```bash
pip install arcade-ai slack_sdk
```

### Define your authorized tool

Create a new Python file, e.g., `slack_tools.py`, and import the necessary modules:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from arcade.sdk import ToolContext, tool
from arcade.sdk.auth import Slack
from arcade.sdk.errors import RetryableToolError
from slack_sdk import WebClient
```

Now, define your tool using the `@tool` decorator and specify the required authorization, in this case, by using the built-in `Slack` auth provider:

```python
@tool(
    requires_auth=Slack(
        scopes=[
            "chat:write",
            "im:write",
            "users.profile:read",
            "users:read",
        ],
    )
)
def send_dm_to_user(
    context: ToolContext,
    user_name: Annotated[str, "The Slack username of the person you want to message"],
    message: Annotated[str, "The message you want to send"],
):
    """Send a direct message to a user in Slack."""
    slack_client = WebClient(token=context.authorization.token)

    # Retrieve the user ID based on username
    user_list_response = slack_client.users_list()
    user_id = None
    for user in user_list_response["members"]:
        if user["name"].lower() == user_name.lower():
            user_id = user["id"]
            break
    if not user_id:
        raise RetryableToolError(
            "User not found",
            developer_message=f"User with username '{user_name}' not found."
        )

    # Open a conversation and send the message
    im_response = slack_client.conversations_open(users=[user_id])
    dm_channel_id = im_response["channel"]["id"]
    slack_client.chat_postMessage(channel=dm_channel_id, text=message)
```

Arcade offers a number of [built-in auth providers](/home/auth-providers), including Slack, Google, and GitHub. You can also require authorization with a custom auth provider, using the `OAuth2` class, a subclass of the `ToolAuthorization` class:

```python
@tool(
    requires_auth=OAuth2(
        id="your-oauth-provider-id",
        scopes=["scope1", "scope2"],
    )
)
```

<Note>
  The `OAuth2` class requires an `id` parameter to identify the auth provider in the Arcade Engine. For built-in providers like `Slack`, you can skip the `id` - the Arcade Engine will find the right provider using your credentials. While you can specify an `id` for built-in providers, only do this for private tools that won't be shared.
</Note>

### Register your tool

As before, you need to register your tool in a `ToolCatalog`:

```python
from arcade.sdk import ToolCatalog
from slack_tools import send_dm_to_user

catalog = ToolCatalog()
catalog.add_tool(send_dm_to_user)
```

### Use your authorized tool with Arcade

Now you can use your custom authorized tool with Arcade AI in your application.

Here's an example of how to use your tool:

```python
from arcadepy import Arcade
from catalog import catalog

client = Arcade()  # Automatically finds the `ARCADE_API_KEY` env variable

user_id = "user@example.com"

# Use the tool in a chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Send a message to johndoe on Slack saying 'Hello!'",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=list(catalog.tools.keys()),
    tool_choice="auto",
    user=user_id,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Handle authorization

Since your tool requires authorization, the first time you use it, the user (identified by `user_id`) needs to authorize access.

Arcade AI handles the authorization flow, prompting the user to visit a URL to grant permissions.

Your application should guide the user through this process.

</Steps>

### How it works

By specifying the `requires_auth` parameter in the `@tool` decorator, you indicate that the tool needs user authorization.

Arcade AI manages the OAuth flow, and provides the token in `context.authorization.token` when the tool is executed. Arcade AI also remembers the user's authorization tokens, so they won't have to go through the authorization process again until the auth expires or is revoked.
