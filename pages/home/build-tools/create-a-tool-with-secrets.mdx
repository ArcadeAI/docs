# Adding secrets to your tools

In this guide, you'll learn how to add secrets to your custom tools, using Arcade.

Secrets are sensitive strings like passwords, api-keys, or other tokens that grant access to a protected resource or API.

In this example, you'll create a tool that reads data from a postgres database.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade](/home/quickstart)
- [Understand Tool Context](/home/build-tools/tool-context)

We will be using `sqlalchemy` and `psycopg2-binary` to access a postgres database.


<Tabs items={["uv", "pip"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
uv pip install arcade-ai sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
pip install arcade-ai sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Define your tool

Create a new Python file, e.g., `sql_tools.py`, and import the necessary modules:
```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/build-tools/create-a-tool/imports.py
```

Now, define your tool using the `@tool` decorator and specify the needed secrets with `requires_secrets`, in this case a `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING`.  In this example, `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING`, is meant to be a JDBC-style database connection URL, e.g. `postgres://user:password@hostname.com/database_name`.  Our `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` will contain a username and password in this case, making it very sensitive.

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/build-tools/create-a-tool/sql-tool.py
```

### Use your tool with Arcade

Now you can use your custom authorized tool with Arcade in your application.

Here's an example of how to use your tool.  Note that for this example, the table schema includes a `users` table and a `messages` table, and `messsages` has a foreign key back to `users`.

<details>

<summary>See full schema</summary>

```sql file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/build-tools/create-a-tool/schema.sql
```
</details>


```ts file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/build-tools/create-a-tool/app.ts.fake
```

You'll get a response like this:

```bash
‚öôÔ∏è Found the following tools:
Sql_DiscoverTables: Discover all the tables in the database
Sql_ExecuteQuery: Execute a query and return the results
Sql_GetTableSchema: Get the schema of a table

[üîç] Discovered the following tables: users, messages
[üìú] Schema for users: id: int,name: str,email: str,password_hash: str,created_at: datetime,updated_at: datetime
[üìú] Schema for messages: id: int,body: str,user_id: int,created_at: datetime,updated_at: datetime


[‚ùì] Asking: Get the first 10 users's IDs and Names
[üìù] SQL statement: SELECT id, name FROM users ORDER BY id LIMIT 10;
[ "(1, 'Sam')", "(3, 'Evan')", "(12, 'Wils')" ]

[‚ùì] Asking: Who has sent the most chat messages?
[üìù] SQL statement: SELECT u.name, COUNT(m.id) AS message_count FROM users u JOIN messages m ON u.id = m.user_id GROUP BY u.name ORDER BY message_count DESC LIMIT 1;
[ "('Evan', 218)" ]
```

</Steps>

### Supplying the Secret

Note how in the example above we never provided a value for `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING`.  This is because we want the Arcade engine to manage this for us, keeping the sercets that the tool needs seperate from the environment that is exceuting the LLM calls (our application above).

Using Arcade Cloud, after publishing your tool with [`arcade deploy`](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/serve-tools/arcade-deploy), you will see that your tool requires the `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` secret:

You can manage your secrets from the [`secrets` section](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/auth/secrets) of the authentication section:
