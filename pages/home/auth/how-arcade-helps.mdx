# How Arcade helps with Agent Authorization

### The challenges that Arcade solves

Applications that use models to perform tasks (_agentic applications_) commonly require access to sensitive data and services. Authentication complexities often hinder AI from performing tasks that require user-specific information, like what emails you recently received or what's coming up on your calendar.

To retrieve this information, agentic applications need to be able to authenticate and authorize access to external services you use like Gmail or Google Calendar.

Authenticating to retrieve information, however, is not the only challenge. Agentic applications also need to authenticate in order to **act** on your behalf - like sending an email or updating your calendar.

Without auth, AI agents are severely limited in what they can do.

### How Arcade solves this

Arcade provides an authorization system that handles OAuth 2.0, API keys, and user tokens needed by AI agents to access external services through tools. This means your AI agents can now act on behalf of users securely and privately.

With Arcade, developers can now create agents that can _act as the end users of their application_ to perform tasks like:

- Creating a new Zoom meeting
- Sending or reading email
- Answering questions about files in Google Drive.

### How to implement OAuth2-authorized tool calling

To learn how Arcade allows for actions (tools) to be authorized through OAuth2 and how to implement it, check out [Authorized Tool Calling](/home/auth/auth-tool-calling).


### Tools that don't require authorization

Some tools, like [`Search.SearchGoogle`](/toolkits/search/google_search#searchgoogle), allow AI agents to retrieve information or perform actions without needing user-specific authorization.
