## Custom Auth Flow with CrewAI

In this guide, we will explore how to create a custom auth flow that will be performed before executing Arcade tools within your CrewAI agent team. Follow the step-by-step instructions below.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](/home/api-key)

### Set up your environment

Install the required package, and ensure your environment variables are set with your Arcade and OpenAI API keys:

```bash
pip install crewai-arcade
```

### Configure API keys

Provide your Arcade and OpenAI API keys. You can store them in environment variables like so:

```bash
export ARCADE_API_KEY="your_arcade_api_key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

### Define your custom auth flow

The custom auth flow defined in the following code snippet is a function that will be called whenever CrewAI needs to call a tool.

```python
from typing import Any

from crewai_arcade import ArcadeToolManager

USER_ID = "user@example.com"

def custom_auth_flow(
    manager: ArcadeToolManager, tool_name: str, **tool_input: dict[str, Any]
) -> Any:
    """Custom auth flow for the ArcadeToolManager

    This function is called when CrewAI needs to call a tool that requires authorization.
    Authorization is handled before executing the tool.
    This function overrides the ArcadeToolManager's default auth flow performed by ArcadeToolManager.authorize_tool
    """
    # Get authorization status
    auth_response = manager.authorize(tool_name, USER_ID)

    # If the user is not authorized for the tool,
    # then we need to handle the authorization before executing the tool
    if not manager.is_authorized(auth_response.id):
        print(f"Authorization required for tool: '{tool_name}' with inputs:")
        for input_name, input_value in tool_input.items():
            print(f"  {input_name}: {input_value}")
        # Handle authorization
        print(f"\nTo authorize, visit: {auth_response.url}")
        # Block until the user has completed the authorization
        auth_response = manager.wait_for_auth(auth_response)

        # Ensure authorization completed successfully
        if not manager.is_authorized(auth_response.id):
            raise ValueError(f"Authorization failed for {tool_name}. URL: {auth_response.url}")
    else:
        print(f"Authorization already granted for tool: '{tool_name}' with inputs:")
        for input_name, input_value in tool_input.items():
            print(f"  {input_name}: {input_value}")


def tool_manager_callback(tool_manager: ArcadeToolManager, tool_name: str, **tool_input: dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
    """Tool executor callback with custom auth flow for the ArcadeToolManager

    ArcadeToolManager's default executor handles authorization and tool execution.
    This function overrides the default executor to handle authorization in a custom way and then executes the tool.
    """
    custom_auth_flow(tool_manager, tool_name, **tool_input)
    return tool_manager.execute_tool(USER_ID, tool_name, **tool_input)
```

### Create and manage Arcade tools

You can now provide the tool manager callback to the `ArcadeToolManager` upon initialization:

```python
# Provide the tool manager callback to the ArcadeToolManager
manager = ArcadeToolManager(executor=tool_manager_callback)

# Retrieve the provided tools and/or toolkits as CrewAI StructuredTools.
tools = manager.get_tools(tools=["Google.ListEmails"], toolkits=["Slack"])
```

### Use Your Tools in Your CrewAI Agent Team

Create a Crew that uses your tools with the custom auth flow. When the tool is called, your tool manager callback will be called to handle the authorization and then the tool will be executed.

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai.llm import LLM

crew_agent = Agent(
    role="Main Agent",
    backstory="You are a helpful assistant",
    goal="Help the user with their requests",
    tools=tools,
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True,
    llm=LLM(model="gpt-4o"),
)

task = Task(
    description="Get the 5 most recent emails from the user's inbox and summarize them and recommend a response for each.",
    expected_output="A bulleted list with a one sentence summary of each email and a recommended response to the email.",
    agent=crew_agent,
    tools=crew_agent.tools,
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[crew_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,
)

result = crew.kickoff()

print("\n\n\n ------------ Result ------------ \n\n\n")
print(result)
```
