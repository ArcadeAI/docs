## Custom Auth Flow with CrewAI

In this guide, we will explore how to create a custom auth flow that will be performed before executing Arcade tools within your CrewAI agent team.

The `ArcadeToolManager`'s built-in authorization and tool execution flows work well for many typical use cases. However, some scenarios call for a tailored approach. By implementing a custom auth flow, you gain flexibility in handling tool authorization. If your use case calls for a unique interface, additional approval steps, or specialized error handling, then this guide is for you.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](/home/api-keys)

### Set up your environment

Install the required package, and ensure your environment variables are set with your Arcade and OpenAI API keys:

```bash
pip install crewai-arcade
```

### Configure API keys

Provide your Arcade and OpenAI API keys. You can store them in environment variables like so:

```bash
export ARCADE_API_KEY="your_arcade_api_key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

### Define your custom auth flow

The custom auth flow defined in the following code snippet is a function that will be called whenever CrewAI needs to call a tool.

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/crewai/custom_auth_flow_callback_section.py
```

### Get Arcade tools

You can now provide the tool manager callback to the `ArcadeToolManager` upon initialization:

```python
# Provide the tool manager callback to the ArcadeToolManager
manager = ArcadeToolManager(executor=tool_manager_callback)

# Retrieve the provided tools and/or toolkits as CrewAI StructuredTools.
tools = manager.get_tools(tools=["Google.ListEmails"], toolkits=["Slack"])
```

### Use tools in your CrewAI agent team

Create a Crew that uses your tools with the custom auth flow. When the tool is called, your tool manager callback will be called to handle the authorization and then the tool will be executed.

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai.llm import LLM

crew_agent = Agent(
    role="Main Agent",
    backstory="You are a helpful assistant",
    goal="Help the user with their requests",
    tools=tools,
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True,
    llm=LLM(model="gpt-4o"),
)

task = Task(
    description="Get the 5 most recent emails from the user's inbox and summarize them and recommend a response for each.",
    expected_output="A bulleted list with a one sentence summary of each email and a recommended response to the email.",
    agent=crew_agent,
    tools=crew_agent.tools,
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[crew_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,
)

result = crew.kickoff()

print("\n\n\n ------------ Result ------------ \n\n\n")
print(result)
```

</Steps>
