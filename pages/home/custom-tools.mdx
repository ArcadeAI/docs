# Quickstart

First, make sure you have these pre-requisites installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10** or higher <br/> Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
- **pip**: The Python package installer should be available. It's typically included with Python.
- **Arcade Account**: Sign up for an [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup) if you haven't already.

Let's set up Arcade and give it a try!

<Steps>

### Obtain an API key

You'll need an Arcade API key to get started. Visit the [How to get an API key](/home/api-keys) page to create one if you haven't already.

### Try `arcade chat`

With Arcade CLI installed, you can test out our API with the `arcade chat` command:

```bash
arcade chat
```

This launches a chat with the Arcade Cloud Engine (hosted at `api.arcade.dev`). All pre-built Arcade tools are available to use.

For example, try asking:

```
star the ArcadeAI/arcade-ai repo on Github
```

Arcade will ask you to authorize with GitHub, and then the AI assistant will star the [ArcadeAI/arcade-ai](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai) repo on your behalf.

You'll see output similar to this:

```
Assistant (gpt-4o):
I starred the ArcadeAI/arcade-ai repo on Github for you!
```

You can use Ctrl-C to exit the chat at any time.

### Try more tools

Try prompting the AI with different requests:

- Search the web to find when The Winds of Winter will be released
- Summarize my emails from today
- What's playing on my Spotify right now?

To see all tools available in the Cloud, run:

```bash
arcade show
```

</Steps>

Great job! 🎉 You've set up Arcade and used your first tool.

### Next steps

- [Learn about tools](use-tools/tools-overview) and how they work
- Learn how to [call tools with models](use-tools/call-tools-with-models)
- Or, jump ahead to building your own [custom tools](build-tools/create-a-toolkit)
