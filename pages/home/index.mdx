## Welcome to Arcade AI!

Arcade AI empowers any developer to seamlessly integrate large language models (LLMs) with real-world systems, enabling secure, user-authenticated interactions with data and services.

By bridging the gap between powerful AI models and practical applications, Arcade AI makes it easy for developers to build tools that perform real-world actions on behalf of users, unlocking the true potential of AI in practical applications.
