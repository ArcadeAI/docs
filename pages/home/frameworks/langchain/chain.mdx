## Use LangChain with Arcade

In this guide, we'll walk through how to use Arcade AI tools with LangChain to build powerful AI applications.

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade AI](/home/quickstart)
- Install the required packages:

  ```bash
  pip install arcade-ai langchain-openai langchain-arcade
  ```

<Steps>

### Import the necessary packages

Begin by importing the required libraries:

```python
import os
from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_openai_functions_agent
from langchain_arcade import ArcadeToolManager
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```

### Set up API keys

Ensure your environment variables `ARCADE_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set with your actual API keys.

```python
arcade_api_key = os.environ["ARCADE_API_KEY"]
openai_api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
```

### Initialize the Arcade Tool Manager

The `ArcadeToolManager` helps you fetch and manage tools from Arcade AI. Initialize it with your Arcade AI API key:

```python
manager = ArcadeToolManager(api_key=arcade_api_key)
```

### Retrieve specific tools

Fetch specific tools by specifying their names. Tool names follow the format `ToolkitName.ToolName`:

```python
tools = manager.get_tools(tools=["Web.ScrapeUrl"])
print(manager.tools)
```

You may notice that "_" and "." are used interchangeably in the tool names. This is due to the fact that some language models do not allow "." in tool names. Given this, Arcade allows you to use either "_" or "." in tool names interchangeably.

**Output:**

```
['Web_ScrapeUrl']
```

This retrieves the `ScrapeUrl` tool from the `Web` toolkit.

### Retrieve a Toolkit

You can initialize all tools from a specific toolkit:

```python
# Clear existing tools and initialize new ones from the "Search" toolkit
manager.init_tools(toolkits=["Search"])
print(manager.tools)
```

**Output:**

```
['Search_SearchGoogle']
```

This replaces the current tools with those from the `Search` toolkit.

### Add more tools from other toolkits

Use `get_tools` to add additional tools without clearing existing ones:

```python
# Add tools from the "Math" toolkit
tools = manager.get_tools(toolkits=["Math"])
print(manager.tools)
```

**Output:**

```
['Search_SearchGoogle', 'Math_Add', 'Math_Divide', 'Math_Multiply', 'Math_Sqrt', 'Math_Subtract', 'Math_SumList', 'Math_SumRange']
```

Now you have several mathematical tools alongside your search tool.

### Create the Language Model and Agent

Define your agent and wrap it with an executor for processing:

```python
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent")
model = ChatOpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)
agent = create_openai_functions_agent(model, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

### Execute the agent with example queries

Try out your agent with sample inputs:

```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "Lookup Seymour Cray on Google"})
```

**Output:**

```
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Invoking: `Search_SearchGoogle` with `{'query': 'Seymour Cray'}`

[Search results about Seymour Cray]

> Finished chain.
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "What is 1234567890 * 9876543210?"})
```

**Output:**

```
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Invoking: `Math_Multiply` with `{'a': 1234567890, 'b': 9876543210}`

12193263111263526900

> Finished chain.
```

</Steps>

## Tips for Selecting Tools

- **Relevance:** Include only the tools necessary for your agent's tasks to optimize performance.
- **Avoid Conflicts:** Be cautious of tools with overlapping functionalities that might cause ambiguity.

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up an agent with Arcade AI tools, you can:

- Explore more complex queries and tasks.
- Integrate additional toolkits to expand capabilities.
- Customize the agent's prompt for specific behaviors.
- Experiment with different language models for varied performance.
