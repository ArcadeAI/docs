# Getting Your API Key


Before you begin, you'll need an Arcade account - if you haven't created one yet, you can <SignupLink utmParams={{
            utm_source: "docs",
            utm_medium: "page",
            utm_campaign: "get-api-key",
          }} linkLocation="docs:get-api-key">sign up here</SignupLink>. Once you have an account, you can generate API keys through either our dashboard or CLI.
