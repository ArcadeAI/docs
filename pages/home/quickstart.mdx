# Quickstart

Let's get started with Arcade AI. You can use Arcade AI in several ways:

- Through our interactive CLI tool
- Using our Python or TypeScript libraries
- Directly via REST API endpoints

## Prerequisites

1. An Arcade AI account - [Sign up here](https://arcade-ai.typeform.com/early-access)
2. (Optional) Python 3.8+ for Python SDK
3. (Optional) Node.js 16+ for TypeScript SDK

## Try Arcade Chat

The fastest way to try Arcade AI is through our CLI tool:

```bash
# Install the CLI
pip install arcade-ai

# Log in to get your API key
arcade login

# Start chatting!
arcade chat
```

Try these prompts in the chat:

- "Star the ArcadeAI/arcade-ai repo on Github"
- "What's the weather in San Francisco?"
- "Summarize my recent emails"

## Use with Python

Install and use our Python SDK:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.arcade-ai.com",
    api_key=os.environ["ARCADE_API_KEY"]
)

# Make a request using a tool
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's 625 squared?"}],
    tools=[{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Math.SquareRoot"}}],
    tool_choice="generate",
    user="your.email@example.com"
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Use with TypeScript

Use OpenAI's TypeScript SDK:

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

export const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://api.arcade-ai.com/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.ARCADE_API_KEY,
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What's 625 squared?" }],
  tools: ["Math.SquareRoot"],
  tool_choice: "auto",
  user: "your.email@example.com",
});

console.log(response.data.choices[0].message.content);
```

## Use via REST API

You can also call our API endpoints directly from any language:

```bash
curl https://api.arcade-ai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the squared root of 625"}],
    "tools": ["Math.Sqrt"],
    "tool_choice": "generate",
    "user": "your.email@example.com"
  }'
```

## What's happening?

1. Arcade AI routes your requests through our engine
2. The AI model gets access to the tools you specify
3. The model can use these tools to perform real actions
4. Results are returned through the same interface

## Next steps

1. [Call tools with models](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) - Learn more about using AI models with tools
2. [Specify tools](/home/use-tools/specify-tools) - Control which tools are available to the AI
3. [Call tools directly](/home/use-tools/call-tools-directly) - Use tools programmatically without AI
4. [Tool authorization](/home/use-tools/auth-tool-calling) - Learn how to handle tools that need user authorization
