# Quickstart

First, make sure you have these pre-requisites installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10** or higher <br/> Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
- **pip**: The Python package installer should be available. It's typically included with Python.
- **Arcade AI Account**: Sign up for an [Arcade AI account](https://arcade-ai.com/signup) if you haven't already.

Let's set up Arcade AI and give it a try!

<Steps>

### Install Arcade AI

```bash
pip install 'arcade-ai[fastapi]'
```

This will install the `arcade` CLI and our development SDK.

### Log in to Arcade AI

```bash
arcade login
```

Your Arcade API key will be saved to `~/.arcade/arcade.toml`.

### Try `arcade chat`

With Arcade CLI installed, you can test out our API with the `arcade chat` command:

```bash
arcade chat
```

This launches a chat with the Arcade Cloud Engine (hosted at `api.arcade-ai.com`). All pre-built Arcade tools are available to use.

For example, try asking:

```
star the ArcadeAI/langchain-arcade repo on Github
```

Arcade AI will ask you to authorize with GitHub, and then the AI assistant will star the [ArcadeAI/langchain-arcade](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/langchain-arcade) repo on your behalf.

You'll see output similar to this:

```
Assistant (gpt-4o):
I starred the ArcadeAI/langchain-arcade repo on Github for you!
```

You can use Ctrl-C to exit the chat at any time.

### Try more tools

Try prompting the AI with different requests:

- Search the web to find when The Winds of Winter will be released
- Summarize my emails from today
- What's playing on my Spotify right now?

</Steps>

Great job! ðŸŽ‰ You've set up Arcade AI and used your first tool.
