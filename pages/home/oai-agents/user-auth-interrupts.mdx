## User authorization with OpenAI Agents

In this guide, you will learn how to handle user authorization for Arcade tools in your OpenAI Agents application. When a tool requires authorization, the agent will raise an `AuthorizationError` with a URL for the user to visit and grant permissions.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](/home/api-keys)

### Install the required packages

Set up your environment with the following installations:

```bash
pip install agents-arcade arcadepy
```

### Configure your Arcade environment

Make sure you have set your Arcade API key in the environment, or assign it directly in the code:

> Need an Arcade API key? Visit the [Get an API key](/home/api-keys) page to create one.

```python
import os
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError

# Set your API key
os.environ["ARCADE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY"

# Initialize the Arcade client
client = AsyncArcade()
```

### Fetch Arcade tools

Get the tools you need for your agent. In this example, we'll use GitHub tools:

```python
# Get GitHub tools for this example
tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, ["github"])

# Create an agent with GitHub tools
github_agent = Agent(
    name="GitHub agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can assist with GitHub API calls.",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    tools=tools,
)
```

### Handle authorization errors

When a user needs to authorize access to a tool, the agent will raise an `AuthorizationError`. You can handle it like this:

```python
try:
    result = await Runner.run(
        starting_agent=github_agent,
        input="Star the arcadeai/arcade-ai repo",
        # Pass a unique user_id for authentication
        context={"user_id": "user@example.com"},
    )
    print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
except AuthorizationError as e:
    # Display the authorization URL to the user
    print(f"Please Login to GitHub: {e}")
    # The error contains the authorization URL that the user should visit
```

### Wait for authorization completion

You can also wait for the user to complete the authorization before continuing:

```python
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
import asyncio

client = AsyncArcade()

async def handle_auth_flow(auth_id):
    # Display a message to the user
    print("Please visit the authorization URL in your browser")


    # Wait for the user to authenticate
    await client.auth.wait_for_completion(auth_id)

    # Check if authorization was successful
    if await is_authorized(auth_id):
        print("Authorization successful! You can now use the tool.")
        return True
    else:
        print("Authorization failed or timed out.")
        return False

# In your main function
try:
    # Run agent code
    # ...
except AuthorizationError as e:
    auth_id = e.auth_id
    if await handle_auth_flow(auth_id):
        # Try running the agent again
        result = await Runner.run(
            starting_agent=github_agent,
            input="Star the arcadeai/arcade-ai repo",
            context={"user_id": "user@example.com"},
        )
        print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
```

### Complete example

Here's a full example that demonstrates the authorization flow with waiting for authentication:

```python
```python
from arcadepy.auth import wait_for_authorization_completion

import time

from agents import Agent, Runner
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade

from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError


async def main():
    client = AsyncArcade()
    # Use the "github" toolkit for this example
    tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, ["github"])

    github_agent = Agent(
        name="GitHub agent",
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can assist with GitHub API calls.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=tools,
    )

    user_id = "user@example.com"  # Make sure to use a unique user ID

    while True:
        try:
            result = await Runner.run(
                starting_agent=github_agent,
                input="Star the arcadeai/arcade-ai repo",
                # Pass the user_id for auth
                context={"user_id": user_id},
            )
            print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
            break  # Exit the loop if successful

        except AuthorizationError as e:
            auth_url = str(e)
            print(f"{auth_url}.  Please authenticate to continue.")

            # Wait for the user to authenticate
            await client.auth.wait_for_completion(e.result.id)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(main())
```

This example handles the authentication flow by:

1. Attempting to run the agent
2. Catching any AuthorizationError
3. Open the authentication URL in a browser
4. Waiting for the user to complete authentication
5. Retrying the operation after a wait period


</Steps>

## Authentication persistence

Once a user authorizes an integration, Arcade will remember the authorization for that specific user_id and toolkit. You don't need to re-authorize each time you run the agent.

Key points to remember:

- Always use a consistent and unique `user_id` for each user
- Store the `user_id` securely in your application
- Different toolkits require separate authorization flows
- Authorization tokens are managed by Arcade, not your application

## Next steps

- Build a user interface to handle authorization flows smoothly
- Explore other Arcade toolkits like Google, LinkedIn, or X
- Create multi-step workflows with multiple tools and authorizations
- Learn to build your own custom tools with the Arcade Tool SDK

By handling Arcade's authorization flow correctly, you can build AI-driven applications that securely integrate with various services while respecting user permissions. Have fun exploring Arcade!
