# Tool Execution

Once a tool is called, executing it efficiently and securely is crucial. Arcade AI ensures that tool execution is fast, reliable, and scalable. With built-in features like retry logic, parallel execution, and failover mechanisms, your AI applications can operate at premium performance levels.

Arcade Actors handle the execution of tools, acting as microservices that you can deploy and scale independently. Actors are stateless executable environments that contain a collection of tools. They are called by the engine to execute tool requests and return the results.

You can run an actor locally for development:

```bash
pip install arcade-ai
arcade dev
```

This command starts a local actor where tools installed in your current Python environment are available.

For production environments, you can deploy actors remotely using Docker and host them in setups accessible to the Arcade Engine.

By separating tool execution into actors, Arcade AI manages the workload seamlessly, whether you're running complex data queries or interacting with third-party APIs.

Let's run a tool execution to see how quickly and reliably Arcade AI processes requests.
