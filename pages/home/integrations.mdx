Arcade AI offers four key integration categories:

1. **[Auth Providers](/integrations/auth)**: Enable users to securely grant Arcade AI tools access to their data.
2. **[Prebuilt Toolkits](/integrations/toolkits)**: Ready-to-use tools that connect with popular services and APIs. These include official toolkits built by Arcade AI, verified third-party toolkits, and community contributions. All toolkits can be used through our hosted service or self-hosted in your environment.
