# Install a tool or toolkit

## PyPI Installation

All the Arcade AI-built tools and toolkits are available on PyPI. To install a tool or toolkit, run:

```bash
pip install arcade-[toolkit_name]
```

in the same environment as the arcade-ai package.

For example, to install the math tools, run:

```bash
pip install arcade-math
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
arcade show
```

which should return output similar to:

```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name         ┃ Description                  ┃ Toolkit ┃ Version ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩
│ Math.Add     │ Add two numbers together     │  Math   │  0.1.0  │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

See our [Toolkits Integrations](/integrations#toolkits) for all available toolkits and individual installation instructions.

## Local Package Installation
Locally built toolkits can also be installed with:
```python
pip install .
```
or

```python
pip install <wheel_name>
```

in the same environment as the arcade-ai package.

## Authenticated Tools
Some Toolkits may need authentication through an API key or OAuth, which can be configured in the Arcade Engine. To see the specific configuration requirements, you can checkout our [OAuth Providers](/integrations#auth)
or see required authentication provider in the [Toolkit Description](/integrations/toolkits/Github/github) of each tool.
