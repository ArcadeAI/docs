## Install the Arcade Client

```python
pip install arcade-ai
```

## Install the Arcade AI Engine

To run the Arcade AI engine locally, you need to install the `arcade-engine`. Choose the installation method that matches your operating system.

### macOS (Homebrew)

If you're using macOS, install the Arcade AI Engine using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install arcade-ai/arcade/arcade-engine
```

### Ubuntu/Debian (APT)

For Ubuntu or Debian systems, add the Arcade AI repository and install via APT:

```bash
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.arcade-ai.com/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/arcade-ai.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install arcade-engine
```


### Configure for local engine

By default, the Arcade AI CLI is configured to use the Arcade AI Cloud Engine. If you want to use your local engine, update your configuration:

```bash
arcade config edit --key engine.host --val localhost
arcade config edit --key engine.port --val 9099
arcade config edit --key engine.tls --val False
```

### Start Arcade AI for local development

Before starting the engine, make sure it's in your path:

```bash
which arcade-engine
```

This should return the path to the `arcade-engine` executable.

If it's not in your path, add it:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/arcade-engine
```

With the engine installed, you can start it using the `arcade dev` command:

```bash
arcade dev -c engine-config.yaml -e .env
```

This command starts the Arcade AI engine and an Actor which will serve the toolkits installed in the current python environment.

You should see output similar to:

```
Starting actor server...
Actor> INFO | Serving the following toolkits:
Actor> INFO |   - your_toolkit (arcade_your_toolkit): 1 tools
Actor> INFO | Starting FastAPI server...
Actor> INFO | Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8002 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Starting engine...
Engine> INFO | Arcade Engine is starting...
Engine> INFO | Getting tool definitions from actor
Engine> INFO | Server running on http://0.0.0.0:9099
```

<Note>
  The `arcade dev` command is a convenience command that starts the engine and
  actor and should not be used in production.
</Note>

### Other Operating Systems

For other operating systems, download the appropriate binary from the [Arcade AI Releases](https://arcade-ai.com/releases) page and add it to your system's `PATH`.
