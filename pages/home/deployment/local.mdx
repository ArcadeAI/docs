# Installing Arcade AI Locally

This guide will help you install Arcade AI and set up your development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **pip**: The Python package installer should be available. It's typically included with Python.
- **Arcade AI Account**: Sign up for an [Arcade AI account](https://arcade-ai.com/signup) if you haven't already.
- **[Download and configure](/home/quickstart) the Arcade AI Client**

## Installation

<Steps>

### Install the Arcade AI Engine

To run the Arcade AI engine locally, you need to install the `arcade-engine`. Choose the installation method that matches your operating system.

#### macOS (Homebrew)

If you're using macOS, install the Arcade AI Engine using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install arcade-ai/arcade/arcade-engine
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian (APT)

For Ubuntu or Debian systems, add the Arcade AI repository and install via APT:

```bash
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.arcade-ai.com/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/arcade-ai.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install arcade-engine
```

#### Other Operating Systems

For other operating systems, download the appropriate binary from the [Arcade AI Releases](https://arcade-ai.com/releases) page and add it to your system's `PATH`.

<br />

### Run Arcade Locally

When developing tools and toolkits for Arcade AI, you need to be able to run your own instance of Arcade AI locally.

To run Arcade AI locally, you need to

1. Install a tool or toolkit to serve (in a python env)
2. Start an Actor serving that tool or toolkit (in the same python env)
3. Start the Arcade AI Engine configured with the Actor HTTP address

The `arcade dev` command is provided that provides a single command for steps 2 and 3.

#### Install a tool or toolkit

See the [tool kit installation guide](/home/deployment/tools) for more information on installing tools.

#### Start Arcade AI for local development

Before starting the engine, make sure it's in your path:

```bash
which arcade-engine
```

This should return the path to the `arcade-engine` executable.

If it's not in your path, add it:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/arcade-engine
```

With the engine installed, you can start it using the `arcade dev` command:

```bash
arcade dev -c engine-config.yaml -e arcade.env
```

<Note>If you don't have your own config and env file, you can start with the [Minimal Required Config](/home/configuration/engine#minimal-required-configuration)</Note>

This command starts the Arcade AI engine and an Actor which will serve the toolkits installed in the current python environment.

You should see output similar to:

```
Starting actor server...
Actor> INFO | Serving the following toolkits:
Actor> INFO |   - your_toolkit (arcade_your_toolkit): 1 tools
Actor> INFO | Starting FastAPI server...
Actor> INFO | Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8002 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Starting engine...
Engine> INFO | Arcade Engine is starting...
Engine> INFO | Getting tool definitions from actor
Engine> INFO | Server running on http://0.0.0.0:9099
```

<Warning>The `arcade dev` command is a convenience command that starts the engine and actor and should not be used in production.</Warning>
<br/>
### Use `arcade chat` to test your setup

#### Configure for local engine

By default, the Arcade AI CLI is configured to use the Arcade AI Cloud Engine. If you want to use your local engine, update your configuration:

```bash
arcade config edit --key engine.host --val localhost
arcade config edit --key engine.port --val 9099
arcade config edit --key engine.tls --val False
```

Verify your configuration:

```bash
arcade config
```

You should see output similar to:

```

│ engine  │ host    │ localhost                     │
│         │ port    │ 9099                          │
│         │ tls     │ False                         │
└─────────┴─────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Validate

With the engine running, you can test your setup by starting a chat session:

```bash
arcade chat
```

If you're configured correctly and running the local engine, you should see:

```
> arcade chat

=== Arcade AI Chat ===

Chatting with Arcade Engine at http://0.0.0.0:9099/v1
```

</Steps>

## Next Steps

- **Host in Docker**: See how to run the [Engine in Docker](/home/deployment/docker) for Production Environments.
