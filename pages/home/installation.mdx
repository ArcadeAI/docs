# Installation

Arcade provides [client libraries for multiple languages](/home/arcade-clients). These are the easiest way to integrate Arcade into your applications.

## Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to install the Arcade client for your preferred language, and test it with a simple example.

<Note>
You need to have an Arcade API key to use the clients. You can get one by [following this guide](/home/api-keys).

<Steps>
### Setup your Python environment

The Arcade client requires Python 3.10 or higher. We recommend using `uv` to manage your Python environment. First, [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Then you can safely install the latest version of Python.

```bash
uv python install
```

It's also a good idea to create a virtual environment for your project in a new directory.

```bash
mkdir arcade-project
cd arcade-project
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install the Arcade client

Now that you have Python and a virtual environment, let's install the Arcade client.

```bash
uv pip install arcadepy
```

### Test the client

Now that you have the Arcade client installed, let's test it with a simple example. We'll use the `Arcade` class to create a client, and then use the `list` method to get a list of tools. This will return a list of tools that are available to you in the `GitHub` toolkit.


```python
# main.py
from arcadepy import Arcade

client = Arcade()

tools = client.tools.list(toolkit="github")
print(f"Found these tools in the GitHub toolkit:")
for tool in tools:
    print(f" - {tool.name}")
```

And run it with:
```bash
python main.py
```

Example output:

```
Found these tools in the GitHub toolkit:
 - CountStargazers
 - CreateIssue
 - CreateIssueComment
 - CreateReplyForReviewComment
 - CreateReviewComment
 - GetPullRequest
 - GetRepository
 - ListOrgRepositories
 - ListPullRequestCommits
 - ListPullRequests
 - ListRepositoryActivities
 - ListReviewCommentsInARepository
 - ListReviewCommentsOnPullRequest
 - ListStargazers
 - SetStarred
 - UpdatePullRequest
```

### Setup your environment

The Arcade client requires a JavaScript runtime. We recommend using `bun` to manage your JavaScript environment. First, [install bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation).

We recommend creating a new project directory and installing the client in it.

```bash
mkdir arcade-project
cd arcade-project
bun init
```

### Install the Arcade client

Now that you have bun, let's install the Arcade client.

```bash
bun add @arcadeai/arcadejs
```

### Test the client

Now that you have the Arcade client installed, let's test it with a simple example. We'll use the `Arcade` class to create a client, and then use the `list` method to get a list of tools. This will return a list of tools that are available to you in the `GitHub` toolkit.

```javascript
// main.ts
import { Arcade } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";

const client = new Arcade();

const tools = await client.tools.list({toolkit:"github"});

console.log("Found these tools in the GitHub toolkit:");
for (const tool of tools.items) {
    console.log(` - ${tool.name}`);
}
```
And run it with:
```bash
bun run main.ts
```

Example output:

```
Found these tools in the GitHub toolkit:
 - CountStargazers
 - CreateIssue
 - CreateIssueComment
 - CreateReplyForReviewComment
 - CreateReviewComment
 - GetPullRequest
 - GetRepository
 - ListOrgRepositories
 - ListPullRequestCommits
 - ListPullRequests
 - ListRepositoryActivities
 - ListReviewCommentsInARepository
 - ListReviewCommentsOnPullRequest
 - ListStargazers
 - SetStarred
 - UpdatePullRequest
```
