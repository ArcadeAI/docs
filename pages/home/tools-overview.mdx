# What are tools?

Large language models excel at text generation but struggle with tasks like calculations, data retrieval, or interacting with external systems. To make an analogy, these models have impressive _brains_ (reasoning capabilities), but lack _hands_ to interact with the digital world.

To solve this, many AI models support tool calling (also called function calling). This unlocks the ability for models to use _tools_, which are functions or APIs that perform actions.

### How tool calling works

AI models that support tool calling can determine when and how to use specific tools to fulfill a user's request. It's up to the developer to build the tools and make them available to the model. It's like giving the AI a toolbox and asking them to pick the right tool for the job.

For example, if a user asks, "Who is the CEO of Apple?", the AI can:

1. Recognize the need for current information about Apple's CEO
2. Select a search tool like `Search.Google`
3. Retrieve relevant information from the web
4. Formulate a response using the gathered data

### Tool calling with Arcade AI

Arcade AI simplifies tool calling by providing a standardized interface and pre-built integrations. With Arcade AI's extensive [tool catalog](/integrations#toolkits), you can easily integrate tools that:

- Interact with APIs
- Access databases
- Execute code
- Perform calculations
- Retrieve real-time data

You can also create [custom tools](/home/build-tools/) to fit your unique needs.
