# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Arcade?

Arcade is a platform for building and running AI agents. It provides a SDKs, CLIs, and APIs that make it easy to build, test, and deploy tools to production.  Arcade provides a runtime that can be used to run tools in a secure and scalable way.  Arcade has a registry of tools made made by both the Arcade team and the community.

## What is an AI agent?

An AI agent is a software program that uses LLM AI to perform a task. It can be a chatbot, a customer support agent, a personal assistant, or any other software program that uses AI to perform a task.  Also, an AI agent can be a tool that can be used by other agents.

## What is a Toolkit?

A toolkit is a collection of tools that can be used by an AI agent.  It is a way to organize tools into a single entity that can be managed and deployed.  Toolkits describe how their tools should be authenticated too.

## What is a Tool?

A tool is a software program that can be used by an AI agent. This is sometimes called a "tool call", "function call" or "invocation".  Tools can be used by other tools, and can be used by agents.  Tools fall into a few categories, like "integrations" (calling remote APIs), "Integrations" (focused on interacting with third parties), "Resources" (providing storage and compute, queues and RAG as a service), "Security and Compliance" (tools for "is this fraud", etc), "Commerce" (payments and fulfillment), and "Agents-as-tools" (making multi-agent much easier to implement).

Integration Tools are more than just making an API available to an agent.  To make a successful tool, you often need to orchestrate the calling of many APIs in sequence with workflow logic to embody the the intention of the caller.  For example, `reply to the email I have with Sam and let him know the meeting is at noon` requires a number of calls:
* A lookup to find the email address of Sam
* A lookup to find the latest email from Sam that is talking about a meeting
* Custom code to craft the reply
* Finally, sending the reply.

## What if I need a Tool that Arcade doesn't have?

Arcade makes it easy to build your own tools!  You can fork our existing tools, or build your own from scratch.  Learn more about [building your own toolkit](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).

## How do I contribute back a Tool to the Registry?

We're always looking for new tools and toolkits!  If you have a tool that you think would be useful to others, please let us know.  You can contribute a tool by submitting a pull request to the [Arcade GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai).
