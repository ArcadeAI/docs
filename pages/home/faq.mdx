# Frequently Asked Questions

## What if I need a Tool that Arcade doesn't have?

Arcade makes it easy to build your own tools!  You can fork our existing tools, or build your own from scratch.  Learn more about [building your own toolkit](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).

## How do I contribute back a Tool to the Registry?

We're always looking for new tools and toolkits!  If you have a tool that you think would be useful to others, please let us know.  You can contribute a tool by submitting a pull request to the [Arcade GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai).
