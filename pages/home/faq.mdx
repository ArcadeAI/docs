# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a Tool?

A tool is a software program that can be used by an AI agent. This is sometimes called a "tool call", "function call" or "invocation".  Tools can be used by other tools, and can be used by agents.  Tools fall into a few categories, like "Integrations" (focused on interacting with third parties), "Resources" (providing storage and compute, queues, and common LLM services like RAG), "Security and Compliance" (tools for solving problems like "is this fraud"), "Commerce" (payments and fulfillment), and "Agents-as-tools".

Integration Tools are more than just making an API available to an agent.  To make a successful tool, you often need to orchestrate the calling of many APIs in sequence with workflow logic to embody the intention of the caller.  For example, `reply to the email I have with Sam and let him know the meeting is at noon` requires a number of calls:
* A lookup to find the email address of Sam
* A lookup to find the latest email from Sam that is talking about a meeting
* Custom code to craft the reply
* Finally, sending the reply.

## What if I need a Tool that Arcade doesn't have?

Arcade makes it easy to build your own tools!  You can fork our existing tools, or build your own from scratch.  Learn more about [building your own toolkit](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).

## How do I contribute back a Tool to the Registry?

We're always looking for new tools and toolkits!  If you have a tool that you think would be useful to others, please let us know.  You can contribute a tool by submitting a pull request to the [Arcade GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai).
