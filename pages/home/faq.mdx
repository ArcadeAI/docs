# Frequently Asked Questions

## What if I need a Tool that Arcade doesn't have?

Arcade makes it easy to build your own tools!  You can fork our existing tools, or build your own from scratch.  Learn more about [building your own toolkit](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).

## How do I contribute back a Tool to the Registry?

We're always looking for new tools and toolkits!  If you have a tool that you think would be useful to others, please let us know.  You can contribute a tool by submitting a pull request to the [Arcade GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-ai).

## What is the difference between the Arcade CLI and the Arcade Clients?

The Arcade CLI is a command line tool that makes it easy to build, test, and deploy your own tools to production.  The Arcade Client libraries are what you will use within your own agents and applications to call the tools.
