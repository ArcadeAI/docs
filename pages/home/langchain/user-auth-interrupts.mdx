## User Authorization in LangGraph

In this guide, you will create a LangGraph workflow that requires user authorization before running certain Arcade tools. When a tool needs authorization, the graph displays an authorization URL and waits for the user's approval. This ensures that only the tools you explicitly authorize are available to the language model.

<Steps>

### Install the required packages

Set up your environment with the following installations:

```bash
pip install langchain-arcade langchain-openai langgraph
```

### Configure your Arcade environment

Make sure you have set your Arcade API key (and any other relevant keys) in the environment, or assign them directly in the code:

> Need an Arcade API key? Visit the [How to get an API key](/home/api-keys) page to create one.

```python
import os

# Import necessary classes and modules
from langchain_arcade import ArcadeToolManager
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import END, START, MessagesState, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

arcade_api_key = os.environ["ARCADE_API_KEY"]

# Initialize the tool manager and fetch tools compatible with langgraph
tool_manager = ArcadeToolManager(api_key=arcade_api_key)
tools = tool_manager.get_tools(toolkits=["Google"])
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Create a language model instance and bind it with the tools
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools)
```

Here are the main code elements:

- arcade_api_key is your Arcade key.
- tool_manager fetches your Arcade tools, for example the "Google" toolkit.
- tool_node encapsulates these tools for usage in LangGraph.
- model_with_tools binds your tools to the "gpt-4o" language model, enabling tool calls.

### Define the workflow steps

You will create three primary functions to handle AI interaction, tool authorization, and flow control.

```python
# Function to invoke the model and get a response
def call_agent(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    # Return the updated message history
    return {"messages": [response]}


# Function to determine the next step in the workflow based on the last message
def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    if state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
        for tool_call in state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
            if tool_manager.requires_auth(tool_call["name"]):
                return "authorization"
        return "tools"  # Proceed to tool execution if no authorization is needed
    return END  # End the workflow if no tool calls are present


# Function to handle authorization for tools that require it
def authorize(state: MessagesState, config: dict):
    user_id = config["configurable"].get("user_id")
    for tool_call in state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
        tool_name = tool_call["name"]
        if not tool_manager.requires_auth(tool_name):
            continue
        auth_response = tool_manager.authorize(tool_name, user_id)
        if auth_response.status != "completed":
            # Prompt the user to visit the authorization URL
            print(f"Visit the following URL to authorize: {auth_response.url}")

            # Wait for the user to complete the authorization
            # and then check the authorization status again
            tool_manager.wait_for_auth(auth_response.id)
            if not tool_manager.is_authorized(auth_response.id):
                # This stops execution if authorization fails
                raise ValueError("Authorization failed")

    return {"messages": []}
```

Explanations for these functions:

- call_agent: Invokes the language model using the latest conversation state.
- should_continue: Checks the last AI message for any tool calls. If a tool requires authorization, the flow transitions to authorization. Otherwise, it goes straight to tool execution or ends if no tools are called.
- authorize: Prompts the user to authorize any required tools, blocking until authorization is completed successfully or fails.

### Build and compile your LangGraph workflow

Use StateGraph to assemble the nodes and edges, then compile the graph with a MemorySaver.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Build the workflow graph using StateGraph
    workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

    # Add nodes (steps) to the graph
    workflow.add_node("agent", call_agent)
    workflow.add_node("tools", tool_node)
    workflow.add_node("authorization", authorize)

    # Define the edges and control flow between nodes
    workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
    workflow.add_conditional_edges("agent", should_continue, ["authorization", "tools", END])
    workflow.add_edge("authorization", "tools")
    workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")

    # Set up memory for checkpointing the state
    memory = MemorySaver()

    # Compile the graph with the checkpointer
    graph = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

### Provide inputs and run the graph

Finally, define user-supplied messages, authorization config, and stream the outputs. The graph will pause for any required tool authorization.

```python
    # Define the input messages from the user
    inputs = {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Check and see if I have any important emails in my inbox",
            }
        ],
    }

    # Configuration with thread and user IDs for authorization purposes
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "4", "user_id": "user@example.com"}}

    # Run the graph and stream the outputs
    for chunk in graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="values"):
        # Pretty-print the last message in the chunk
        chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

In this example:

- The user prompts the agent to check emails.
- The message triggers a potential need for the "Google" tools.
- If authorization is required, the code prints a URL and waits until you permit the tool call.

</Steps>

## Next steps

- Experiment with more Arcade toolkits for expanded capabilities.
- Explore advanced authorization logic, such as multi-user or role-based checks.
- Integrate additional nodes to handle more complex flows or multi-step tasks in your LangGraph.

By combining Arcade's authorization features with stateful management in LangGraph, you can build AI-driven workflows that respect user permissions at every step. Have fun exploring Arcade!
