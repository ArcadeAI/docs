# Use specific tools

Applies to:

- [Calling tools with models](call-tools-with-models)

When you use a language model with Arcade AI, you can specify what tool(s) it can use:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models/single_model_call.py#L14-L29 {11-14}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```js file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models/single_model_call.js#L13-L25 {11}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The `tools` parameter accepts:

- An array of one or more tool names, like `GitHub.SetStarred`. The model will only have access to the specified tools.
- An empty array (or nothing) to include all tools. The model will have access to all tools available to the Arcade Engine.

Even the best AI models struggle to choose between too many tools. For most use cases, specifying a list of tools will maximize accuracy and reliability.

<Tip>
  Coming soon: The ability to specify custom groups of tools. Stay tuned!
</Tip>

To control how the model selects from the available tools, see [Control tool choice](tool-choice).
