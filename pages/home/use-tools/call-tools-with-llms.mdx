# Call tools with LLMs

In this guide, you'll learn how to call tools in an AI workflow using OpenAI and Arcade AI.

To do this, you'll build an AI chatbot that can star GitHub repositories on your behalf using the [`GitHub.SetStarred`](/integrations/toolkits/Github/github#setstarred) tool.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade AI](/home/quickstart)
- Sign up for an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and follow their [Python quickstart guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?language-preference=python)

### Initialize the OpenAI client

Start a new Python file in your favorite editor. If you followed the OpenAI quickstart guide, use the `example.py` file you created.

Use the `OpenAI` client, and change the base URL and API key to point to Arcade AI:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-llms/github_stars_chatbot.py#L1-L8 {1,6-7}

```

Requests made with this client will be routed to Arcade AI first, then to OpenAI. The AI model will instantly have access to the tools provided by Arcade AI.

### Set the user ID

Authorized tools access data on behalf of an end-user, so they need to know the user's ID.

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-llms/github_stars_chatbot.py#L10-L11

```

For now, put your own email address in `user_id`.

In a web or mobile app, you'd get this from the current user session.

### Generate a response

With the client set up, use `client.chat.completions.create` to generate a response to a user's prompt:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-llms/github_stars_chatbot.py#L13-

```

### Try it!

Run your script:

```bash
python github_stars_chatbot.py # or example.py
```

Ask the AI to:

```
star the ArcadeAI/arcade-ai repo
```

You'll be prompted to authorize the connection to GitHub, and then the AI will perform the action.

</Steps>

### How it works

When you use `tool_choice="generate"` and specify a tool like `GitHub.SetStarred`, Arcade AI coordinates the interaction between the tool and the AI model (OpenAI). To your users, it appears that the model magically has new capabilities.

<Note>
  In this example, Arcade Cloud Engine is executing the pre-built tool
  `GitHub.SetStarred`. You can also [create your own custom
  tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).
</Note>

### Add more tools

Try adding more tools to the `tools` array to give the AI model more capabilities:

- Add `Math.SquareRoot` and ask for the square root of a big number
- Add `X.WritePost` and ask the AI to post on X for you

### Next steps

For apps and agents that aren't directly generating chat completions, you can [authorize and call tools programmatically](call-tools-in-code). This is useful when you need more control over the tool calling process.

When you're ready to build your own tools, read about [how to create tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit).
