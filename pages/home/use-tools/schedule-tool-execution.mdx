# Schedule tool execution

In this guide, you'll learn how to schedule tools to run at a future time with Arcade.dev.

Scheduled tool execution allows you to set up tools to run automatically at a specific time in the future. This is useful for tasks like sending notifications, generating reports, or performing maintenance operations on a schedule.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade.dev](/home/quickstart)
- Create an Arcade.dev [API key](/home/api-keys), if you haven't already
- Understand how to [call tools directly](/home/use-tools/call-tools-directly)

### Set environment variables

You can find your Arcade.dev API key in one of these locations:

- [Arcade.dev Dashboard](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/api-keys) under API Keys
- `~/.arcade/credentials.yaml`

Export your Arcade.dev API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export ARCADE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

### Initialize the client

Import and initialize the Arcade.dev client. The client automatically uses the `ARCADE_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
# No client initialization needed for REST API
# Just include your API key in the Authorization header

### Schedule a tool execution

Let's schedule the `Github.CreateIssue` tool to run at a future time. You'll need to specify:

1. The tool name
2. The input parameters for the tool
3. The time when the tool should run
4. Optionally, a user ID for attribution

```bash
# Schedule tool execution
curl -X POST "https://api.arcade.dev/v1/tools/execute" \

    "input": {
      "owner": "ArcadeAI",
      "repo": "Docs",
      "title": "Scheduled issue creation",
      "body": "This issue was created by a scheduled tool execution"
    },
    "run_at": "2025-01-09T15:00:00-08:00"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "te_2ur7QJuXu2eEHZWvPb6QBmEN76D",
  "execution_id": "tc_2ur7QLXCUFsbo0HDY5ZAaM3mwei",
  "execution_type": "scheduled",
  "run_at": "2025-01-09T15:00:00-08:00",
  "status": "pending",
  "success": true
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The response includes an ID that you can use to check the status of the scheduled execution later.

### List scheduled tool executions

You can retrieve a list of all scheduled tool executions to monitor their status.

### Use cases for scheduled tool execution

Let's explore some common use cases for scheduled tool execution:

1. **Automated reporting**: Schedule tools to generate and send reports at regular intervals
2. **Maintenance tasks**: Schedule cleanup operations or database maintenance during off-peak hours
3. **Delayed notifications**: Schedule notifications to be sent at appropriate times
4. **Workflow automation**: Trigger the next step in a workflow after a specified delay
5. **Scheduled content updates**: Automatically update content or publish posts at optimal times

By scheduling tool executions, you can automate repetitive tasks and ensure they run at the most appropriate times.
