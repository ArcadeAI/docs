# Call tools directly

In this guide, you'll learn how to call tools programmatically using Arcade AI.

Unlike [calling tools with LLMs](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-llms), calling tools directly doesn't use an AI model to decide which tool to call and what arguments to pass. Instead, you specify the tool and its arguments in code.

You still get the benefits of Arcade AI managing authorization and tool execution, but you have more control over when and how the tool is called. This is useful in apps and AI agents where the workflows are more complex than a single LLM call.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade AI](/home/quickstart)

### Set environment variables

```bash
export ARCADE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

You can find your API key in `~/.arcade/credentials.yaml`.

### Initialize the client

Import the `Arcade()` client in a Python script. The client automatically uses the `ARCADE_API_KEY` environment variable.

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/use-tools/call-tools-directly/github_star_directly.py#L1-L3

```

### Call a tool

Let's use the [`SetStarred` tool](/integrations/toolkits/Github/github#setstarred) from the [Arcade GitHub toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/Github/github) to star a repo.

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/use-tools/call-tools-directly/github_star_directly.py#L5-L11

```

</Steps>
