# Calling Tools with Authentication

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

<Steps>

### Initialize the client

Import the Arcade AI client in a Python script. The client automatically finds API keys set by `arcade login`.

```python
from arcade.client import Arcade

client = Arcade()
```

### Authorize a tool directly

Many tools require authorization. For example, the `Google.GetEmails` tool requires authorization with Google.

This authorization must be approved by the user. By approving, the user allows your agent or app to access only the data they've approved.

```python
from arcade.client import AuthProvider

# As the developer, you must identify the user you're authorizing
# and pass a unique identifier for them (e.g. an email or user ID) to Arcade:
THE_USER_ID = "you@example.com"

# Request access to the user's Gmail account
auth_response = client.tools.authorize(
    tool_name="Google.GetEmails",
    user_id=THE_USER_ID,
)

print(f"Click this link to authorize: {auth_response.auth_url}")
```

This will print a URL that the user must visit to approve the authorization.

### Check for authorization status

It may take a few minutes for the user to approve the authorization.

Check for the authorization status by polling the `auth_id` from the authorization response:

```python
auth_status = client.auth.status(auth_response.auth_id)
print(f"Authorization status: {auth_status}")
```

### Call the tool with authorization

Once the user has approved the action, you can run the tool. You only need to pass the `user_id`:

```python
emails_response = client.tools.run(
    tool_name="Google.GetEmails",
    user_id=MY_USER_ID,
)
print(emails_response)
```

### How it works

When you call a tool with `client.tools.run()`, Arcade AI:

1. Checks for authorization.
2. Routes the request to the tool's provider.
3. Returns the tool's response.

With `client.tools.authorize()`, you can also authorize tools for later use.

These APIs give you programmatic control over tool calling. If you just want to integrate tools into an LLM workflow, see [Call tools with LLMs](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-llms).

### Next steps

Once you've mastered tool calling, see how you can [build your own tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) to integrate any custom functionality or API to your AI workflows.
