# Configuration

## Configuration Files
On [installation](/home/install/local), Arcade installs a templated Engine configuration and Environment variable.

See the [Specifying a Config File](/home/configure/engine#specify-a-config-file) for usage.

### Engine Configuration

The Engine configuration `engine.yaml` location varies based on installation method.
- **Homebrew**: `$HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY/etc/arcade-engine/engine.yaml` (commonly `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/etc/arcade-engine/engine.yaml`)
- **Apt**: `/etc/arcade-ai/engine.yaml`
- **Manual Download**: Manually downloaded configs can be added to `$HOME/.arcade/engine.yaml`

<Note>To manually download the engine.yaml, you can get an example from the [Configuration Templates](/home/configure/templates)</Note>

Engine configurations support variable expansion for [Secrets](/home/configure/engine#secrets) and [Environment Files](/home/configure/engine#dotenv-files).

You can edit the `engine.yaml` file for to change configurations for the [Engine](/home/configure/engine) and [Supported Models](/home/configure/models).

### Environment File

Arcade installs a default `arcade.env` file to the `$HOME/.arcade/` directory on login,
which can be seen on the [Configuration Templates](/home/configure/templates) page.

The installed file contains default variables to run the Engine locally, and can be changed or
overridden by exporting variables to your environment through the command line.
