# Arcade Engine configuration

Arcade Engine's configuration is a [YAML file](https://yaml.org/) with the following sections:

<TableOfContents
  headers={["Section", "Description"]}
  data={[
    ["API Configuration", "Configures the server for specific protocols"],
    ["Auth Configuration", "Configures user authorization providers and token storage"],
    ["Cache Configuration", "Configures the short-lived cache"],
    ["Model Configuration", "Defines a collection of AI models for routing"],
    ["Security Configuration", "Configures security and encryption"],
    ["Storage Configuration", "Configures persistent storage"],
    ["Telemetry Configuration", "Configures telemetry and observability (OTEL)"],
    ["Tools Configuration", "Configures tools for AI models to use"],
  ]}
/>

## Specify a config file

To start the Arcade Engine, pass a config file with `-c` or `--config`:

```bash
arcade-engine -c /path/to/config.yaml
```

Or, for local development:

```bash
arcade dev -c /path/to/config.yaml
```

## Dotenv files

Arcade Engine automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files in the directory where it was called. Use the `-e` or`--env` flag to specify a path:

```bash
arcade-engine -e .env.dev -c config.yaml
```

## Secrets

Arcade Engine supports two ways of passing sensitive information like API keys without storing them directly in the config file.

Environment variables:

```yaml {5}
llm:
  models:
    - id: primary
      openai:
        api_key: ${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

External files (useful in cloud setups):

```yaml {5}
llm:
  models:
    - id: primary
      openai:
        api_key: ${file:/path/to/secret}
```

## API configuration

HTTP is the supported protocol for Arcade Engine's API. The following configuration options are available:

- `api.development` _(optional, default: `false`)_ - Enable development mode, with more logging and simple [worker authentication](/home/configure/engine#http-worker-configuration)
- `api.http.host` _(default: `localhost`)_ - Address to which Arcade Engine binds its server (e.g., `localhost` or `0.0.0.0`)
- `api.http.read_timeout` _(optional, default: `30s`)_ - Timeout for reading data from clients
- `api.http.write_timeout` _(optional, default: `1m`)_ - Timeout for writing data to clients
- `api.http.idle_timeout` _(optional, default: `30s`)_ - Timeout for idle connections
- `api.http.max_request_body_size` _(optional, default: `4Mb`)_ - Maximum request body size

A typical configuration for production looks like:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/full_config.1.0.yaml#L4-L7

```

For local development, set `api.development = true`. In development mode, Arcade Engine does not require [worker authentication](/home/configure/engine#http-worker-configuration).


## Auth configuration

Arcade Engine manages auth for [AI tools](/home/auth/auth-tool-calling) and [direct API calls](/home/auth/call-third-party-apis-directly). It supports many built-in [auth providers](/home/auth-providers), and can also connect to any [OAuth 2.0](/home/auth-providers/oauth2) authorization server.

The `auth.providers` section defines the providers that users can authorize with. Each provider must have a unique `id` in the array. There are two ways to configure a provider:

For [built-in providers](/home/auth-providers), use the `provider_id` field to reference the pre-built configuration. For example:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/full_config.1.0.yaml#L9-L17 {7}

```

For custom OAuth 2.0 providers, specify the full connection details in the `oauth2` sub-section. For full documentation on the custom provider configuration, see the [OAuth 2.0 provider configuration](/home/auth-providers/oauth2) page.

You can specify a mix of built-in and custom providers.


## Cache configuration

The `cache` section configures the short-lived cache.

<Note>
  Configuring the cache is optional. If not configured, the cache will default to an in-memory cache implementation suitable for a single-node Arcade Engine deployment.
</Note>

The `cache` section has the following configuration options:

- `api_key_ttl` _(optional, default: `10s`)_ - The time-to-live for API keys in the cache

Two cache implementations are available:
- `in_memory` - _(default)_ An in-memory cache implementation suitable for a single-node Arcade Engine deployment.
- `redis` - A Redis cache implementation suitable for a multi-node Arcade Engine deployment:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/full_config.1.0.yaml#L74-L79 {3-6}

```


## Model configuration

The `llm.models` section defines the models that the engine can route to, and the API keys or parameters for each model. Each item in the `models` array must have a unique `id` and a provider-specific configuration.

This example shows configuration for connecting to OpenAI and Anthropic:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/full_config.1.0.yaml#L81-L89

```

For more details on model configuration and model-specific parameters, see [model configuration](/home/configure/models).

### Routing

When client code calls the Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models), it specifies a model by name. Arcade Engine matches the model name to a model in the configuration and routes the request to the appropriate provider.

If more than one model provider is configured, Arcade Engine will attempt to route to the correct provider using known model names.

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/model_selection.implicit.py {9}

```

If two model providers have the same models or a custom model is used, the provider can be explicitly specified using its `id`.

For example, given an `llm.models` configuration with one provider named `primary`, this request will be routed to `primary` with the model `gpt-4o`:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/model_selection.explicit.py#L5- {5}

```

## Security configuration

The `security` section configures the root encryption keys that the Arcade Engine uses to encrypt and decrypt data at rest. See the [storage configuration](#storage-configuration) section below to configure where data is stored.

A typical configuration looks like this:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/full_config.1.0.yaml#L91-L95

```

Keys should be a long random string of characters. For example:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Default root key

When you [install Arcade Engine locally](/home/install/local), an `engine.env` file is created with a default root key:

```bash file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/engine.env#L7-L8 {2}

```

This default value can only be used in development mode (see [API configuration](#api-configuration) above).

<Warning>
  You **must** replace the value of `ROOT_KEY_1` in `engine.env` before deploying to production.
</Warning>

## Storage configuration

The `storage` section configures the storage backend that the Arcade Engine uses to store persistent data.

There are three storage implementations available:

- `in_memory` - _(default)_ An in-memory database, suitable for testing.
- `sqlite` - A SQLite file on disk, suitable for local development:
```yaml
storage:
  sqlite:
    # Stores DB in ~/.arcade/arcade-engine.sqlite3
    connection_string: '@ARCADE_HOME/arcade-engine.sqlite3'
```

- `postgres` - A PostgreSQL database, suitable for production:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/full_config.1.0.yaml#L99-L106

```


## Telemetry configuration

Arcade supports logs, metrics, and traces with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).

If you are using the Arcade Engine locally, you can set the `environment` field to `local`. This will only output logs to the console:

```yaml
telemetry:
  environment: local
  logging:
    # debug, info, warn, error, fatal
    level: debug
    encoding: console
```


To connect to OpenTelemetry compatible collectors, set the necessary [OpenTelemetry environment variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/) in the `engine.env` file.
`environment` and `version` are fields that are added to the telemetry attributes, which can be filtered on later.

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/full_config.1.0.yaml#L108-L112

```

### Notes

- The Engine service name is set to `arcade_engine`
- Traces currently cover the `/v1/health` and `/v1/chat/completions` endpoints, as well as authentication attempts


## Tools configuration

Arcade Engine orchestrates [tools](/home/use-tools/tools-overview) that AI models can use. Tools are executed by distributed workers called **workers**, which are grouped into **directors**.

The `tools.directors` section configures the workers that are available to service tool calls:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/home/configuration/engine/full_config.1.0.yaml#L114-L125 {5-12}

```

When a worker is added to an enabled director, all of the tools hosted by that worker will be available to the model and through the Arcade API.

### HTTP worker configuration

The `http` sub-section configures the HTTP client used to call the worker's tools:

- `uri` _(required)_ - The base URL of the worker's tools
- `secret` _(required)_ - Secret used to authenticate with the worker
- `timeout` _(optional, default: `30s`)_ - Timeout for calling the worker's tools
- `retry` _(optional, default: `3`)_ - Number of times to retry a failed tool call

<Note>
  Workers must be configured with a `secret` that is used to authenticate with
  the worker. This ensures that workers are not exposed to the public internet
  without security.

If `api.development = true`, the secret will default to `"dev"` for local development **only**. In production, the secret must be set to a random value.

</Note>
