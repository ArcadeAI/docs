# Build an Arcade AI worker with FastAPI

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of building a worker with FastAPI that can serve tools from a pre-built toolkit.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade AI](/home/quickstart)
- Install the Arcade AI SDK and any necessary dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install arcade-ai fastapi pydantic
  ```

### Install a Pre-Built Toolkit

Arcade AI offers a variety of pre-built toolkits that you can install and use immediately. For this guide, we'll use the `arcade-math` toolkit as an example.

- Install the `arcade-math` toolkit:

  ```bash
  pip install arcade-math
  ```

### Create a FastAPI Application to Serve the Toolkit

We'll set up a FastAPI application that acts as a Worker to serve the tools from the installed toolkit.

1. **Create a new Python file** (e.g., `main.py`) and import the necessary modules:

   ```python
   import os

   from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
   from pydantic import BaseModel

   from arcade.worker.fastapi.worker import FastAPIWorker
   from arcade.sdk import Toolkit
   from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
   import arcade_math
   ```

2. **Ensure Arcade API Key is Set**

   The Arcade API key is automatically loaded from the `ARCADE_API_KEY` environment variable. If you haven't set this yet, you can do so by running:

   ```bash
   export ARCADE_API_KEY="your_api_key"   # On Windows use `set`
   ```

3. **Initialize the Arcade Client**

   ```python
   client = AsyncArcade()
   ```

4. **Initialize the FastAPI Application and Worker**

   ```python
   app = FastAPI()

   worker_secret = os.environ.get("ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET")
   worker = FastAPIWorker(app, secret=worker_secret)
   ```

5. **Register the Toolkit with the Worker**

   ```python
   worker.register_toolkit(Toolkit.from_module(arcade_math))
   ```

6. **Create a Pydantic Model for Chat Requests**

   ```python
   class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
       message: str
       user_id: str
   ```

7. **Define the Chat Endpoint**

   ```python
   @app.post("/chat")
   async def postChat(request: ChatRequest, tool_choice: str = "execute"):
       try:
           raw_response = await client.chat.completions.create(
               messages=[
                   {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                   {"role": "user", "content": request.message},
               ],
               model="gpt-4o-mini",
               max_tokens=500,
               tools=[],  # List your tools here if needed
               tool_choice=tool_choice,
               user=request.user_id,
           )
       except Exception as e:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
       else:
           return raw_response.choices
   ```

### Run Your Application

Ensure you have the `ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET` environment variable set for authentication:

```bash
export ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET="your_worker_secret_key"  # On Windows use `set`
```

Start your FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### Test the Setup

You can now send a POST request to the `/chat` endpoint with a message, and the assistant will respond using the tools from the `arcade-math` toolkit.

Example request using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "What is the square root of 16?", "user_id": "user@example.com"}'
```

### Customize the Tools (Optional)

If you wish to specify which tools to make available in the assistant's responses, modify the `tools` parameter in the `postChat` function:

```python
tools = ["Math.Sqrt"]  # Replace with the actual tool names
```

</Steps>

### How It Works

- **Arcade Worker**: The `FastAPIWorker` serves your tools over HTTP, allowing them to be called by the Arcade Engine.
- **Toolkit Registration**: By registering the toolkit with the Worker, you make all tools within `arcade_math` available to your application.
- **Arcade Client**: The `AsyncArcade` client is used to interact with the Arcade AI services, sending chat completions and making use of the tools.
- **Chat Endpoint**: The `/chat` endpoint accepts user messages and processes them using the AI assistant, leveraging the tools provided.

### Next Steps

- **Explore Other Toolkits**: Install other pre-built toolkits like `arcade-search` or `arcade-slack` to add more functionality.
- **Build Custom Tools**: When you're ready, learn how to [create your own custom toolkits](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) to extend your application's capabilities.
- **Enhance the Assistant**: Customize the assistant's behavior by modifying the system prompt or adjusting parameters like `model` and `max_tokens`.
