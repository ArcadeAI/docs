# Build custom worker images with docker

This guide shows you how to build a custom Worker image using Arcade's base Worker image. It takes you through creating a Dockerfile, installing toolkits, and running the resulting container.

<Steps>

### Requirements

- Docker installed on your machine

### Create your Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile in your project directory:

```dockerfile
ARG VERSION=latest

FROM ghcr.io/arcadeai/worker-base:${VERSION}

# Copy the file that lists all your desired toolkits
COPY toolkits.txt ./

# Install these toolkits
RUN pip install -r toolkits.txt
```

With this Dockerfile, we start from the Arcade worker base image, copy in a file named toolkits.txt, and install each toolkit listed there.

---

## List Your Toolkits

Create a file named toolkits.txt in the same directory. Add the toolkits you want installed:

```
arcade-google
arcade-web
arcade-zoom
```

Adjust this file as needed. Each line in toolkits.txt should specify a Python package name and version.

---

## 3. Build the Image

From the directory containing the Dockerfile and toolkits.txt, run:

```bash
docker build -t custom-worker:0.1.0 .
```

This command creates a Docker image named custom-worker with the tag 0.1.0 using the instructions in your Dockerfile.

---

## Run the Worker

To start the worker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8002:8002 \
  -e ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET="your_secret_here" \
  custom-worker:0.1.0
```

Replace "your_secret_here" with a secret of your choice. Your engine will need access to this secret to call your worker. The worker will be accessible on port 8002 of your local machine.

</Steps>

---

## Next Steps

- Set environment variables (like ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET) securely for production use.
- Deploy your container to a suitable environment (Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or another container orchestration platform).

Happy coding with Arcade!
