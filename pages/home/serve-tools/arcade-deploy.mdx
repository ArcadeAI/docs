# Deploying to the cloud with Arcade Deploy

This guide shows you how to deploy a worker with a local toolkit with Arcade Deploy.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10** or higher <br/> Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
- **Arcade Account**: Sign up for an <SignupLink utmParams={{
            utm_source: "docs",
            utm_medium: "page",
            utm_campaign: "custom-tools",
          }} linkLocation="docs:custom-tools">Arcade account</SignupLink> if you haven't already.
- **Arcade CLI**: Install the Arcade CLI with `pip install arcade-ai`.

<Steps>

## Create your deployment config

Create a `worker.toml` file in your project directory:

```yaml
### Worker 1
[[worker]]

[worker.config]
id = "my-worker"
secret = <your secret> # Replace with your own secret

[worker.local_source]
packages = ["./<your-toolkit-directory>"] # Replace with the path to your toolkit directory
```
<Note>
  For more information on the `worker.toml` file, see the [Arcade Deploy documentation](/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy).
</Note>
---

## Deploy your worker

Run the deploy command in the directory containing your `worker.toml` file:

```bash
arcade deploy
```

You should see output like the following:
```bash
Deploying 'my-worker...'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 main.py:589

## List your workers

Run the following command to list your workers:

```bash
arcade worker list
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash
                                                     Workers

└───────────┴────────────────┴───────────────────┴─────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────┘
```

</Steps>

Your worker and toolkits are now deployed and registered with the engine and ready to use!
