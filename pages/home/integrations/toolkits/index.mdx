# Toolkits

Toolkits are prebuilt integrations that help you integrate popular services and APIs into your Arcade AI projects. There are three types of toolkits available in the ecosystem:

## Official toolkits

Official toolkits are developed and maintained by the Arcade AI core team. These toolkits provide core functionality and are thoroughly tested to ensure reliability and performance. They follow our best practices and are regularly updated to support the latest features.

## Verified toolkits

Verified toolkits are created by the community but have been reviewed and verified by the Arcade AI core team. These toolkits:
- Meet our quality standards and best practices
- Have passed security reviews
- Are regularly tested for compatibility
- Include comprehensive documentation

## Community toolkits

Community toolkits are created and maintained by the Arcade AI community. While these toolkits expand the ecosystem's capabilities, they:
- May not follow all official conventions
- Have varying levels of maintenance
- Are not officially verified by the core team

Let's explore how to use these different types of toolkits in your projects.
