# Slack auth provider

The Slack auth provider enables tools and agents to call [Slack APIs](https://api.slack.com/docs) on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Slack auth provider seamlessly manage Slack OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

<Tip>
  Want to quickly get started with Slack in your agent or AI app? The pre-built
  [Arcade Slack toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/slack) is what you want!
</Tip>

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Slack auth with Arcade AI.

This auth provider is used by:

- The [Arcade Slack toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/slack), which provides pre-built tools for interacting with Slack
- Your [app code](#using-slack-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call the Slack API
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-slack-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call the Slack API

## Configuring Slack auth

How you configure the Slack auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

With the Arcade Cloud Engine, you can start building and testing Slack auth without any configuration. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the Slack auth provider with your own Slack app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a Slack app

- Follow Slack's guide to [registering a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/quickstart)
- Choose the scopes (permissions) you need for your app
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade-ai.com/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret

### Configuring Slack auth with the Arcade Cloud Engine

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Coming soon! In 0.1.0-preview, the Arcade Cloud Engine does not yet support
  configuring auth providers.
</Warning>

### Configuring Slack auth with a self-hosted Arcade Engine

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SLACK_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
SLACK_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `slack` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-5}

```

</Steps>

## Using Slack auth in app code

Use the Slack auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Slack API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Slack API:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/custom_auth.py {8-17}

```

## Using Slack auth in custom tools

The Arcade [Model API](/home/use-tools/call-tools-with-models) is a convenient way to call language models and automatically invoke tools. You can use the pre-built [Arcade Slack toolkit](/integrations/toolkits/slack) to quickly build agents and AI apps that interact with Slack.

If the pre-built tools in the Slack toolkit don't meet your needs, you can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Slack API.

Use the `Slack()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Slack. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Slack token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/slack/custom_tool.py {5-6,10-19,30}

```
