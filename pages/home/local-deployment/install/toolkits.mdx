# Install a tool or toolkit

## Running a Local worker

To run a local worker without the Arcade Gateway, you can run the following command locally:

```bash
arcade serve
```

This will check for any toolkits installed in the current python virtual environment and register them with the worker.

You can also pass in the `--host` and `--port` flags to specify the host and port to run the worker on. The default host is `127.0.0.1` and the default port is `8002`.


## PyPI Installation

All Arcade toolkits are available on PyPI. To install a toolkit, run the following in the same python virtual environment as the arcade-ai package:

```bash
pip install arcade-[toolkit_name]
```

For example, to install the math toolkit, run:

```bash
pip install arcade-math
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
arcade show --local
```

which should return output similar to:

```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name         ┃ Description                  ┃ Toolkit ┃ Version ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩
│ Math.Add     │ Add two numbers together     │  Math   │  0.1.0  │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

These are all tools that are installed in the same python virtual environment as the arcade-ai package.

See our [Toolkits Overview page](/toolkits) for all available toolkits and individual installation instructions.

## Local Package Installation

Locally built toolkits can also be installed with:

```python
pip install .
```

or

```python
pip install <wheel_name>
```

in the same python virtual environment as the arcade-ai package.

## Hosted Toolkits

To add a toolkit to a hosted worker such as FastAPI, you can register them in the worker itself. This allows you to explicitly define which tools should be included on a particular worker.

```python
import arcade_math

app = FastAPI()

worker_secret = os.environ.get("ARCADE_WORKER_SECRET")
worker = FastAPIWorker(app, secret=worker_secret)

worker.register_toolkit(Toolkit.from_module(arcade_math))
```

## Showing Tools From a Hosted Engine

To show all tools that are available on an engine, you can run

```bash
arcade show -h <engine_host> -p <engine_port>
```

```

## Authenticated Tools

Some Toolkits may need authentication through an API key or OAuth, which can be configured in the Arcade Gateway. To see the specific configuration requirements, you can checkout our [Auth Providers](/home/auth-providers).
