# Spotify auth provider

<Note>
  At this time, Arcade does not offer a default Spotify Auth Provider. To use
  Spotify auth, you must create a custom Auth Provider with your own Spotify
  OAuth 2.0 credentials as described below.
</Note>

The Spotify auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Spotify API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Spotify auth provider seamlessly manage Spotify OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Spotify auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-spotify-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Spotify APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-spotify-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Spotify APIs

## Configuring Spotify auth

How you configure the Spotify auth provider depends on whether you use the Arcade Cloud Engine or a [self-hosted Engine](/home/install/overview).

When you are ready to go to production, you'll want to configure the Spotify auth provider with your own Spotify app credentials, so users see your app name when they authorize access.

### Create a Spotify app

- Follow Spotify's guide to [registering an app](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)
- Choose the "Web API" product (at a minimum)
- Set the redirect URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- Copy the client ID and client secret to use below

Next, add the Spotify app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring Spotify auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Spotify** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-spotify-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Spotify app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Spotify auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Spotify OAuth provider.

### Configuring Spotify auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `spotify` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Spotify auth in app code

Use the Spotify auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Spotify API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Spotify API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Spotify auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Spotify API.

Use the `Spotify()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Spotify. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Spotify token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/spotify/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,19}

```
