# Why Agent Auth?

Securely accessing user data and services has always been a challenge for AI
applications. Authentication complexities often hinder AI from performing tasks
that require user-specific information, like checking emails or updating
calendars.

Arcade AI introduces a robust agent authorization system that handles OAuth 2.0,
API keys, and user tokens seamlessly. This means your AI agents can now act on
behalf of users securely and privately.

For example, to access a user's Gmail account, you can initiate an authorization
flow:

```python
from arcade.client import Arcade

client = Arcade()

# Unique identifier for the end user
user_id = "user@example.com"

# Request access to the user's Gmail account
auth_response = client.tools.authorize(
    tool_name="Google.ListEmails",
    user_id=user_id,
)

print(f"Please authorize access by visiting: {auth_response.auth_url}")
```

After the user completes the authorization, you can check the status:

```python
# Poll for authorization status
while auth_response.status != "completed":
    time.sleep(5)
    auth_response = client.auth.status(auth_response.auth_id)
```

Once authorized, your AI agent can securely access the user's emails:

```python
emails_response = client.tools.run(
    tool_name="Google.ListEmails",
    user_id=user_id,
)
print(emails_response)
```

By managing authentication, Arcade AI unlocks new capabilities, allowing AI to
interact with services like Google Workspace, Slack, and more without
compromising security.

Start leveraging agent authorization to build AI solutions that truly
personalize user experiences.
