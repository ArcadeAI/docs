# Purpose

We created Arcade AI to help developers build complex AI applications quickly
and securely. First, why is it so hard to build AI apps?

There are a number of challenges that developers face when building AI
applications:

-   **Authentication and authorization**: APIs and services, especially private
    or corporate ones, often require specific authorization.
-   **Speed and cost**: AI models can be slow and expensive to run, so code that
    interacts with models needs to be performant.
-   **Hallucinations**: AI models can produce incorrect or misleading
    information, so properly guiding them is crucial.
-   **Testing**: Because AI models are non-deterministic, testing in a
    repeatable way is tricky.
-   **Going to production**: All of the above make productionizing AI
    applications hard and costly.

### How Arcade AI makes building AI apps easier

Arcade AI provides a framework for seamlesly connecting AI models to **tools**:
pre-built or custom functions that models can use to interact with external
systems in your AI app or agent.

Tools encapsulate behavior, business logic, and data access logic.

Consider the difference between accessing public information and private user
data:

-   **Tools that don't require authentication**: Some tools, like
    `serp.GoogleSearch`, allow AI agents to retrieve information from the web
    without needing user-specific authentication.

    ```python
    from arcade.client import Arcade

    client = Arcade()

    # Use the serp.GoogleSearch tool to perform a web search
    search_response = client.tool.run(
        tool_name="serp.GoogleSearch",
        inputs={"query": "Latest AI advancements"},
    )
    print(search_response)
    ```

-   **Tools that require authentication**: Other tools, like
    `Google.ListEmails`, require user authorization to access private data such
    as emails.

    ```python
    from arcade.client import Arcade

    client = Arcade()

    # Unique identifier for the end user
    user_id = "user@example.com"

    # Request access to the user's Gmail account
    auth_response = client.tools.authorize(
        tool_name="Google.ListEmails",
        user_id=user_id,
    )

    print(f"Please authorize access by visiting: {auth_response.auth_url}")

    # Wait for the user to authorize and then run the tool
    # (Assume authorization is completed)
    emails_response = client.tools.run(
        tool_name="Google.ListEmails",
        user_id=user_id,
    )
    print(emails_response)
    ```

By managing authentication seamlessly, Arcade AI enables your AI applications to
securely access user-specific data and perform actions on behalf of users. This
unblocks authentication roadblocks and simplifies complex integrations, allowing
you to build AI solutions that are both conversational and actionable.

Let's explore how Arcade AI is redefining what's possible with AI through
authenticated tool-calling.
