# Purpose

Arcade AI bridges the gap between LLM applications and the real world by providing authenticated tool-calling for developers. Traditional AI systems are powerful yet isolated, lacking the means to interact with external data and services securely. Arcade AI solves this by offering a platform where AI can perform real-world actions on behalf of users, access user-specific data, and integrate with a wide range of services.

Consider the difference between accessing public information and private user data:

- **Tools that don't require authentication**: Some tools, like `serp.GoogleSearch`, allow AI agents to retrieve information from the web without needing user-specific authentication.

  ```python
  from arcade.client import Arcade

  client = Arcade()

  # Use the serp.GoogleSearch tool to perform a web search
  search_response = client.tool.run(
      tool_name="serp.GoogleSearch",
      inputs={"query": "Latest AI advancements"},
  )
  print(search_response)
  ```

- **Tools that require authentication**: Other tools, like `Google.ListEmails`, require user authorization to access private data such as emails.

  ```python
  from arcade.client import Arcade

  client = Arcade()

  # Unique identifier for the end user
  user_id = "user@example.com"

  # Request access to the user's Gmail account
  auth_response = client.tools.authorize(
      tool_name="Google.ListEmails",
      user_id=user_id,
  )

  print(f"Please authorize access by visiting: {auth_response.auth_url}")

  # Wait for the user to authorize and then run the tool
  # (Assume authorization is completed)
  emails_response = client.tools.run(
      tool_name="Google.ListEmails",
      user_id=user_id,
  )
  print(emails_response)
  ```

By managing authentication seamlessly, Arcade AI enables your AI applications to securely access user-specific data and perform actions on behalf of users. This unblocks authentication roadblocks and simplifies complex integrations, allowing you to build AI solutions that are both conversational and actionable.

Let's explore how Arcade AI is redefining what's possible with AI through authenticated tool-calling.
