# Using Arcade AI with Agents

Integrating Arcade AI with AI agents unlocks a new realm of possibilities. Agents can now perform tasks that were previously impossible due to authentication and integration challenges. With Arcade AI:

- **Authentication is simplified**: Agents securely access user-specific data using managed OAuth flows.
- **Integration is effortless**: Connect agents to a variety of tools and services without worrying about complex APIs.
- **Performance is optimized**: Agents execute tasks faster with Arcade AI's efficient tool management.

For example, you can integrate Arcade AI with agent frameworks like LangChain or LangGraph. Here's how to use Arcade AI with LangGraph:

```python
from arcade.client import Arcade
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_google_community import GmailToolkit

client = Arcade(api_key="your_api_key")
user_id = "user@example.com"

# Authorize the user with Gmail
auth_response = client.tool.authorize(
    tool_name="ListEmails",
    user_id=user_id,
)
# Assume authorization is completed...

# Obtain credentials and set up the Gmail toolkit
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from langchain_google_community.gmail.utils import build_resource_service

creds = Credentials(auth_response.context.token)
api_service = build_resource_service(credentials=creds)

toolkit = GmailToolkit(api_resource=api_service)
tools = toolkit.get_tools()

# Set up the language model and agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, tools)

# Run the agent with a user query
example_query = "Read my latest emails and summarize them."

events = agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [("user", example_query)]},
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

Imagine an AI assistant that can check your emails, schedule meetings, or update project statuses on your behalf. By using Arcade AI with agents, you can build applications that act more intelligently and autonomously.
