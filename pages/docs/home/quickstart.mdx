## Quickstart

**Requirements**
- Python 3.10+

### Install Arcade AI

```bash
pip install arcade-ai
```

### Login to Arcade AI

```bash
arcade login
```

### Check your login status

```bash
arcade config
```

This will show the API key in your terminal that is saved to `~/.arcade/arcade.toml`.

### Use Arcade Client

The Arcade client provides a simple interface to interact with various tools and services offered by Arcade AI. Here's an example of how to use the client to run the `GoogleSearch` tool.

```python
from arcade.client import Arcade

# Initialize the client
client = Arcade(base_url="http://localhost:9099", api_key="your_api_key")

# Run the GoogleSearch tool
search_response = client.tool.run(
    tool_name="GoogleSearch",
    inputs={"query": "Python programming language"},
)
print(search_response)
```


### Calling Authenticated Tools

The following example shows how to run an authenticated tool, in this case the `GetEmails` tool.

```python

from arcade.client import AuthProvider

# as the developer using the client, you pass in the users id
# or however you refer to them in your system
MY_USER_ID = "user123"

# Use the GetEmails tool (requires authentication)
auth_response = client.auth.authorize(
    provider=AuthProvider.Google,
    scopes=["https://googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
    user_id=MY_USER_ID,
)
```

This will return a URL that you need to direct the user to. Something like:

```
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=1234567890&redirect_uri=http://localhost:9099/oauth2/callback&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly&response_type=code
```

The user can then login and approve the action requested by your application, or as we'll show later, by an LLM or agent.


Once the user has approved the action, you can run the tool.

```python
emails_response = client.tool.run(
    tool_name="Google.GetEmails",
    user_id=MY_USER_ID,
)
print(emails_response)
```
