# Tool Calling

Tool calling enables AI models to determine when and how to use specific tools to fulfill user requests. It's like giving AI agents a toolbox and the intelligence to pick the right tool at the right time.

For example, if a user asks, "What's the weather today in New York?", the AI can:

1. Recognize the need for current weather data.
2. Select a weather API tool.
3. Retrieve real-time weather information.
4. Formulate a response using accurate data.

With Arcade AI, implementing tool calling is straightforward. Here's how you can enable an AI model to use tools:

```python
from arcade.client import Arcade

client = Arcade(api_key="your_api_key")
user_id = "user@example.com"

# Generate a response with tool support
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather today in New York?"},
    ],
    model="gpt-4o",
    max_tokens=500,
    user=user_id,

    # Make specific tools available to the AI model
    tools=[
        "Weather.GetCurrent",
    ],

    # Allow the model to choose and use tools
    tool_choice="generate",
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Arcade AI simplifies tool calling by providing a standardized interface and pre-built integrations. You can also create custom tools to fit your unique needs.
