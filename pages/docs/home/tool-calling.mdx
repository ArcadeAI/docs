# Tool Calling

Tool calling enables AI models to determine when and how to use specific tools
to fulfill user requests. It's like giving AI agents a toolbox and the
intelligence to pick the right tool at the right time.

For example, if a user asks, "Who is the CEO of Apple?", the AI can:

1. Recognize the need for current information about Apple's CEO.
2. Select a search tool like "Search.Google".
3. Retrieve relevant information from the web.
4. Formulate a response using the gathered data.

With Arcade AI, implementing tool calling is straightforward. Here's how you can
enable an AI model to use tools:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the OpenAI client, pointing to Arcade AI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.arcade-ai.com",
    api_key=os.environ.get("ARCADE_API_KEY")
)

USER_ID = "user@example.com"

# Generate a response with tool support
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who is the CEO of Apple?"},
    ],
    model="gpt-4o",
    max_tokens=500,
    user=USER_ID,

    # Make specific tools available to the AI model
    tools=[
        "Search.Google",
    ],

    # Allow the model to choose and use tools
    tool_choice="generate",
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Arcade AI simplifies tool calling by providing a standardized interface and
pre-built integrations. You can also create custom tools to fit your unique
needs.

Let's try implementing tool calling in your AI application to make it more
interactive and useful.
