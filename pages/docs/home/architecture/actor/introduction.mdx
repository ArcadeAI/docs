# Introduction

Actors are stateless executable environments that contain a collection of tools.
They are called by the engine to execute tool requests and return the results.

Can be run locally or remotely and are all independent of one another for easy
scalability.

## Running Actors

### Local Actor

An actor can be run locally using the `arcade dev` command. This is useful for
testing and development. Tools installed in the current python environment are
available to the actor.

### Remote Actor

Actors can be run remotely by running them in a docker container and hosting
them in a docker compatible environment that is accessible to the engine.
