# Directors

Directors manage a group of actors and ensure they are healthy and ready to serve requests.
They determine the routing for tool requests and handle communication between actors and the engine.

When the engine is notified of a new actor, the director makes a request to check its health and check the tools installed on it.
When a tool request is received, the director selects a healthy actor that has the requested tool installed.

Directors also handle the authorization process for any tool request that requires it.


## Example Configuration

Below is an example configuration for a director using a single local actor.

```yaml
director:
  directors:
    - id: default
      enabled: true
      actors:
        - id: "localactor"
          enabled: true
          http:
            uri: "http://localhost:8000"
            timeout: 30
            retry: 3
```
