# Quick start

First, make sure you have these pre-requisites installed on your system:

-   Python 3.10+

Let's set up Arcade AI and give it a try!

<Steps>

### Install Arcade AI

```bash
pip install arcade-ai
```

### Log in to Arcade AI

```bash
arcade login
```

Your Arcade API key will be saved to `~/.arcade/arcade.toml`.

### Use an authorized tool

```bash
arcade chat
```

Try prompting the AI with: **Summarize my last few emails**

Arcade will ask you to authorize with Google, and then you'll see the AI call
the `Google.ListEmails` tool to summarize your recent emails.

</Steps>

### Next steps

In the next section, you'll connect an AI model to authorized tools in your own
code.
