## Quickstart

**Requirements**
- Python 3.10+

<Steps>

### Install Arcade AI

```bash
pip install arcade-ai
```

### Login to Arcade AI

```bash
arcade login
```

### Check your login status

```bash
arcade config
```

This will show the API key in your terminal that is saved to `~/.arcade/arcade.toml`.

### Initialize the Arcade Client

Start by importing the Arcade client and initializing it with your API key.

```python
import os
from arcade.client import Arcade

# Initialize the client
api_key = os.getenv("ARCADE_API_KEY")
client = Arcade(api_key=api_key)
```

### Call a Tool

Here's an example of how to use the client to run the `GoogleSearch` tool.

```python
# Run the GoogleSearch tool
search_response = client.tool.run(
    tool_name="GoogleSearch",
    inputs={"query": "Python programming language"},
)
print(search_response)
```

### Calling Authenticated Tools

The following example shows how to run an authenticated tool, in this case the `Google.GetEmails` tool.

```python

from arcade.client import AuthProvider

# as the developer using the client, you pass in the users id
# or however you refer to them in your system
MY_USER_ID = "user123"

# Authorize your user to access their Gmail
auth_response = client.auth.authorize(
    provider=AuthProvider.Google,
    scopes=["https://googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
    user_id=MY_USER_ID,
)
```

This will return a URL that you need to direct the user to. Something like:

```
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?....
```

### Redirect User to Authorize

The user can then login and approve the action requested by your application, or as we'll show later, by an LLM or agent.


### (Optional) Check for Authorization Status

You can also check for the authorization status of the user provided the `auth_id` from the authorization response.

```python
# use the auth_id from the authorization response
auth_status = client.auth.status(auth_response.auth_id)
print(f"Authorization status: {auth_status}")
```

### Execute the Tool

Once the user has approved the action, you can run the tool.

```python
emails_response = client.tool.run(
    tool_name="Google.GetEmails",
    user_id=MY_USER_ID,
)
print(emails_response)
```

</Steps>
