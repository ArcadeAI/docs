# Creating a Toolkit

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a custom toolkit for
Arcade AI.

You'll create a simple arithmetic toolkit with operations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and more.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade AI](/guides/quickstart)
- Install the Arcade SDK:

```bash
pip install arcade-ai
```

### Create a new toolkit

Use `arcade new` to create a new toolkit:

```bash
arcade new
```

### Define your tools

Create a Python file for your tools, e.g., `arithmetic.py`, and import the
necessary modules:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from arcade.sdk import tool
```

Now, define your tools using the `@tool` decorator:

```python
@tool
def add(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The sum of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Add two numbers together
    """
    return a + b

@tool
def subtract(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The difference of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Subtract two numbers
    """
    return a - b

@tool
def multiply(
    a: Annotated[int, "The first number"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The second number"]
) -> Annotated[int, "The product of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Multiply two numbers together
    """
    return a * b

@tool
def divide(
    a: Annotated[int, "The numerator"],
    b: Annotated[int, "The denominator"]
) -> Annotated[float, "The quotient of the two numbers"]:
    """
    Divide two numbers
    """
    return a / b
```

### Register your tools

In order for Arcade AI to recognize your tools, you need to register them in a
`ToolCatalog`.

Create a new Python file, e.g., `catalog.py`:

```python
from arcade.core.catalog import ToolCatalog
from arithmetic import add, subtract, multiply, divide  # Import your tools

catalog = ToolCatalog()
catalog.add_tool(add)
catalog.add_tool(subtract)
catalog.add_tool(multiply)
catalog.add_tool(divide)
```

### Use your tools with Arcade

Now you can use your custom tools with Arcade AI in your application.

Here's an example of how to use your tools:

```python
from arcade.client import Arcade
from catalog import catalog

client = Arcade(api_key="your_api_key")

# Use the tools in a chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is 6 times 7?"}],
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=list(catalog.tools.keys()),
    tool_choice="auto",
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

</Steps>

### How it works

By decorating your functions with `@tool`, you expose them to the Arcade AI
platform.

The `Annotated` types and docstrings provide metadata that helps the AI
understand how to use your tools.

The `ToolCatalog` collects your tools and makes them available to the AI
assistant.

### Next steps

Try adding more tools to your toolkit, such as `sqrt`, `sum_list`, or
`sum_range`.

Explore advanced features like tool authorization and evaluation to enhance your
tools.
