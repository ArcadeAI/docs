## Running Arcade AI Locally

This guide will help you install Arcade AI and set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **pip**: The Python package installer should be available. It's typically included with Python.
- **Arcade AI Account**: Sign up for an [Arcade AI account](https://arcade-ai.com/signup) if you haven't already.

Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.

<br />

<Steps>

### Setup the Arcade Client

Follow the steps from the [Quickstart Guide](/guides/quickstart) to get the Arcade Client setup.

<br />

### Install the Arcade Engine

To install the Arcade Engine, follow the steps from the [Local Installation Guide](/home/deployment/local)

<br />


### Running Arcade Locally

When developing tools and toolkits for Arcade AI, you need to be able to run your own instance of Arcade AI locally.

To run Arcade AI locally, you need to

1. Install a tool or toolkit to serve (in a python env)
2. Start an Actor serving that tool or toolkit (in the same python env)
3. Start the Arcade AI Engine configured with the Actor HTTP address

the `arcade dev` command is provided that provides a single command for steps 2 and 3.

#### Install a tool or toolkit

All the Arcade AI-built tools and toolkits are available on PyPI. To install a tool or toolkit, run:

```bash
pip install arcade-[toolkit_name]
```

For example, to install the web search tools, run:

```bash
pip install arcade-search
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
arcade show
```

which should return output similar to:

```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name         ┃ Description                  ┃ Toolkit ┃ Version ┃

│              │ results.                     │         │         │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```



### Use `arcade chat` to test your setup

With the engine running, you can test your setup by starting a chat session:

```bash
arcade chat
```

If you're configured correctly and running the local engine, you should see:

```
> arcade chat

=== Arcade AI Chat ===

Chatting with Arcade Engine at http://0.0.0.0:9099/v1
```

Verify your configuration:

```bash
arcade config
```

You should see output similar to:

```

│ engine  │ host    │ localhost                     │
│         │ port    │ 9099                          │
│         │ tls     │ False                         │
└─────────┴─────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```
