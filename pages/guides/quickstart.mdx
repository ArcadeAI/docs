# Quick start

First, make sure you have these pre-requisites installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **pip**: The Python package installer should be available. It's typically
  included with Python.
- **Arcade AI Account**: Sign up for an
  [Arcade AI account](https://arcade-ai.com/signup) if you haven't already.

Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`
in your terminal. Let's set up Arcade AI and give it a try!

<Steps>

### Install Arcade AI

```bash
pip install arcade-ai
```

### Log in to Arcade AI

```bash
arcade login
```

Your Arcade API key will be saved to `~/.arcade/arcade.toml`.

### Try calling a tool with `arcade chat`

With Arcade CLI installed, you can test out our API with the `arcade chat`
command.

```bash
arcade chat
```

This will launch a chat with an Arcade Engine hosted on (`api.arcade-ai.com`).

All, arcade pre-built tools will be available to use.

For example, if you have a gmail, try prompting the AI with: **Summarize my last
few emails**

```markdown
User (dev@arcade-ai.com): Summarize my last few emails

Assistant (gpt-4o): Please visit the URL to authorize this action: [Link](...)
```

Arcade will ask you to authorize with Google, and then the LLM will execute and
use the selected tool to summarize your emails.

You should see an output similar to this:

```markdown
Assistant (gpt-4o):

Here is a summary of your last few emails:

- Subject: Meeting with John Doe about the new project
- Subject: Project updates for the week
- Subject: Reminder for the meeting on Tuesday
```

You can use Ctrl-C to exit the chat at any time.
