# Quick start

First, make sure you have these pre-requisites installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
- **pip**: The Python package installer should be available. It's typically included with Python.
- **Arcade AI Account**: Sign up for an [Arcade AI account](https://arcade-ai.com/signup) if you haven't already.

Let's set up Arcade AI and give it a try!

<Steps>

### Install Arcade AI

```bash
pip install arcade-ai[fastapi,evals]
```

### Log in to Arcade AI

```bash
arcade login
```

Your Arcade API key will be saved to `~/.arcade/arcade.toml`.

### Try calling a tool with `arcade chat`

With Arcade CLI installed, you can test out our API with the `arcade chat` command.

```bash
arcade chat
```

This will launch a chat with the Arcade Cloud Engine (hosted at `api.arcade-ai.com`). All pre-built Arcade tools are available to use.

For example, if you use Gmail, try prompting the AI with: **Summarize my last few emails**

```
User (dev@arcade-ai.com): Summarize my last few emails

Assistant (gpt-4o): Please visit the URL to authorize this action: [Link](...)
```

Arcade will ask you to authorize with Google, and then the LLM will use the selected tool to summarize your emails.

You'll see output similar to this:

```
Assistant (gpt-4o):

Here is a summary of your last few emails:

- Subject: Meeting with John Doe about the new project
- Subject: Project updates for the week
- Subject: Reminder for the meeting on Tuesday
```

You can use Ctrl-C to exit the chat at any time.
