# Local deployment

Learn how to run the Arcade AI engine locally to develop and test your custom
tools.

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

### Prerequisites

- [Install Arcade AI](/home/installation)
- [Build a custom tool](/guides/custom-tools)
- Set up environment variables for any required API keys (e.g.,
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

<Steps>

### Run Arcade AI locally

To run your custom tools, start the Arcade AI engine locally.

In your terminal, run:

```bash
arcade up
```

This command starts the Arcade AI engine and serves your tools.

You should see output similar to:

```
Starting actor server...
Actor> INFO | Serving the following toolkits:
Actor> INFO |   - my_new_toolkit (arcade_my_new_toolkit): 1 tool
Actor> INFO | Starting FastAPI server...
Actor> INFO | Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8002 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Starting engine...
Engine> INFO | Arcade Engine is starting...
Engine> INFO | Getting tool definitions from actor
Engine> INFO | Server running on http://0.0.0.0:9099
```

### Configure the Arcade AI CLI to use the local engine

By default, the Arcade AI CLI is configured to use the cloud engine.

To use your local engine, update your configuration:

```bash
arcade config edit --key engine.host --val 0.0.0.0
arcade config edit --key engine.port --val 9099
arcade config edit --key engine.tls --val False
```

Verify your configuration:

```bash
arcade config
```

You should see:

```

│         │ tls     │ False                         │
└─────────┴─────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

### Test your local setup

Start a chat session to test your local engine:

```bash
arcade chat
```

You should see:

```
=== Arcade AI Chat ===

Chatting with Arcade Engine at http://0.0.0.0:9099/v1

User (you@example.com):
```

Try using your custom tool:

```
User: Say hello to Alice
```

You should receive:

```
Assistant: Hello Alice!
```

### Next steps

- Develop more tools and test them locally.
- Learn how to evaluate your tools in the
  [Evaluate Tools guide](/guides/evaltools).

</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

#### Engine not starting

If `arcade up` does not start the engine, ensure that:

- Your custom tools are installed in your Python environment.
- You are in the correct directory.

#### Missing API keys

If you encounter errors related to missing API keys, set the required
environment variables, such as:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```
