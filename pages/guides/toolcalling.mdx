# Call tools in code

In this guide, you'll learn how to call tools programmatically using Arcade AI.

To do this, you'll write code that uses Arcade AI to call both public tools that
don't require authorization.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

-   [Set up Arcade AI](/guides/quickstart)

### Initialize the client

Import the Arcade AI client in a Python script. The client automatically finds
API keys set by `arcade login`.

```python
import json
from arcade.client import Arcade

client = Arcade()
```

### Call a tool

Let's use the `Search` tool from the Google toolkit to search the web.

```python
# Run the Search.SearchGoogle tool
search_response = client.tools.run(
    tool_name="Search.SearchGoogle",
    inputs=json.dumps({"query": "Python programming language"}),
)
print(search_response)
```

</Steps>

### Next Steps

Next, learn how to call authorized tools and build custom tools.
