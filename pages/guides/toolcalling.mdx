# Call tools in code

In this guide, you'll learn how to call tools programmatically using Arcade AI.

To do this, you'll write code that uses Arcade AI to call both public tools that don't require authorization.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- [Set up Arcade AI](/guides/quickstart)

### Initialize the client

Import the Arcade AI client in a Python script. The client automatically finds API keys set by `arcade login`.

```python
from arcade.client import Arcade

client = Arcade()
```

### Call a tool

Let's use the `Search` tool from the Google toolkit to search the web.

```python
# Run the Google.Search tool
search_response = client.tool.run(
    tool_name="Google.Search",
    inputs={"query": "Python programming language"},
)
print(search_response)
```

</Steps>

### Next Steps

Next, learn how to call authorized tools and build custom tools.
