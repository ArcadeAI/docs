# Understanding ToolContext in Arcade AI

`ToolContext` is a crucial component in Arcade AI that manages authorization and user information for tools requiring authentication. Let's explore how it works and how you can use it in your projects.

## What is ToolContext?

`ToolContext` is a class that holds two main pieces of information:

1. Authorization context: This includes a token for making authenticated requests to external APIs as well as structured user information for providers that support retrieving user information.
2. User ID: This identifies the user invoking the tool.

Some authorization providers may also include additional structured user information in the `ToolContext`.

## How ToolContext Works

When you invoke a tool that requires authorization, Arcade AI's Tool SDK automatically:

1. Creates a `ToolContext` object
2. Passes this object to your tool

You can then use the `ToolContext` object to make authenticated requests to external APIs.

## Using ToolContext in Your Tools

To use `ToolContext`, include it as the first parameter in your tool's function signature. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
import httpx
import json
from typing import Annotated
from arcade.core.schema import ToolContext
from arcade.sdk import tool
from arcade.sdk.auth import GitHub
```

2. Define your tool with `ToolContext` as the first parameter:

```python
@tool(requires_auth=Github())
async def create_issue(
  context: ToolContext,
  owner: Annotated[str, "The owner of the repository"],
  repo: Annotated[str, "The repository to create the issue in"],
  title: Annotated[str, "The title of the issue"],
  body: Annotated[str, "The body of the issue"]
) -> Annotated[str, "The URL of the created issue"]:
  """
  Create an issue in a private GitHub repository
  """
  # TODO: Implement your tool's functionality here
```

3. Implement your tool's functionality using the provided context:

```python
url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues"
headers = {
  "Authorization": f"Bearer {context.authorization.token}",
  "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json",
  "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
}
data = {
  "title": title,
  "body": body
}

async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

return response.json().get("url")
```

## Conclusion

By using `ToolContext`, you can easily manage authorization and user information for tools that require authentication, simplifying the process of interacting with external APIs.
