# Tool errors in Arcade AI

When working with Arcade AI's Tool SDK, you may encounter various types of errors. This guide will help you understand and handle these errors effectively.

## Types of tool errors

Arcade AI defines several error types to handle different scenarios:

1. RetryableToolError
2. ToolExecutionError
3. ToolSerializationError
4. ToolInputError
5. ToolOutputError
6. ToolRuntimeError

## Handling errors in your tools

In most cases, you don't need to raise errors explicitly in your tools. The `@tool` decorator takes care of proper error propagation and handling. When an unexpected error occurs during tool execution, Arcade AI's `ToolExecutor` and `@tool` decorator will raise a `ToolExecutionError` with the necessary context and traceback information.

## Common error scenarios

Let's explore some common error scenarios you might encounter:

### 1. Output type mismatch

```json
{
  "name": "tool_call_error",
  "message": "tool call failed - Github.ListOrgRepositories failed: Failed to
  serialize tool output"
}
```

### 2. Unexpected HTTP error during tool execution

```json
{
  "name": "tool_call_error",
  "message": "tool call failed - Github.ListOrgRepositories failed: Error accessing 'https://api.github.com/orgs/a-private-org/repos': Failed to process request. Status code: 401"
}
```

### 3. Input parameter of a tool is of the wrong type

```
Type error encountered while adding tool list_org_repositories from
arcade_github.tools.repositories. Reason: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class
```
