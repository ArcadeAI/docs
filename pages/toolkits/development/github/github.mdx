The Arcade AI GitHub toolkit provides a pre-built set of tools for interacting with GitHub. These tools make it easy to build agents and AI apps that can:

- Access private repositories (with the user's permission)
- Get info about repositories, issues, pull requests, and more
- Post issues, comments, and replies as the user

## Install

```bash
pip install arcade_github
```

## Auth

The Arcade AI GitHub toolkit uses the [GitHub auth provider](/home/auth-providers/github) to connect to users' GitHub accounts.

With the hosted Arcade AI Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade AI Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only,
  not for production use. To use Arcade AI and GitHub in production, you must
  use a self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade AI, you need to [configure the GitHub auth provider](/home/auth-providers/github#configuring-github-auth) with your own GitHub app credentials.
