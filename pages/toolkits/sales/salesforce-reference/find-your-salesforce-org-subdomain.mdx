# Find your Salesforce Org Subdomain

<Note>
You only need this information if you are:

1. Self-hosting the [Arcade Worker](/home/serve-tools/arcade-deploy#deploy-your-worker); or,
1. Self hosting the [Arcade Engine](/home/configure/engine); or,
1. Using Arcade Cloud with a custom Salesforce auth provider, which is the case if want to use a Salesforce app associated to your organization's account, instead of the Arcade Salesforce app.
</Note>

Follow the steps below to find your Salesforce Org Subdomain:

1. Log into your Salesforce account.
1. Click on the **Setup** gear icon in the top right corner, then click on **Setup**.
1. In the Quick Find box in the top left corner, type "my domain".
1. Under **Company Settings**, click on **My Domain**.
1. Under **My Domain Details**, check the **Current My Domain URL** field and copy the value before the `.my.salesforce.com` part.

For example, if your Salesforce domain is `https://acme-inc.my.salesforce.com`, your Salesforce Org Subdomain is `acme-inc`.

If you have a developer account, your URL might look like `https://acme-inc.develop.my.salesforce.com`. In this case, your Salesforce Org Subdomain is `acme-inc.develop`.
