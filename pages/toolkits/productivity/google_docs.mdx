## Auth

The Arcade Docs toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google) to connect to users' Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.
