The Arcade Drive toolkit provides a pre-built set of tools for interacting with Google Drive. These tools make it easy to build agents and AI apps that can:

- Search Google documents in the user's Google Drive
- Search and retrieve the contents of Google documents in the user's Google Drive

## Install

```bash
pip install arcade_google
```

## Auth

The Arcade Drive toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google) to connect to users' Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only, not
  for production use. To use Arcade and Google Drive in production, you must
  use a self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.
