- Search and retrieve the contents of Google documents in the user's Google Drive

## Install

```bash
pip install arcade_google
```

## Available Tools

These tools are currently available in the Arcade Drive toolkit.

<Tip>
  If you need to perform an action that's not listed here, you can [get in touch
  with us](mailto:contact@arcade.dev) to request a new tool, or [create your
  own tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) with the [Google auth

      },
    },
  ]}
/>

Generate a Google File Picker URL for user-driven file selection and authorization.

This tool generates a URL that directs the end-user to a Google File Picker interface where
where they can select or upload Google Drive files. Users can grant permission to access their
Drive files, providing a secure and authorized way to interact with their files.

This is particularly useful when prior tools (e.g., those accessing or modifying
Google Docs, Google Sheets, etc.) encountered failures due to file non-existence
(Requested entity was not found) or permission errors. Once the user completes the file
picker flow, the prior tool can be retried.

## Auth

The Arcade Drive toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google) to connect to users' Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.
