The Arcade Drive toolkit provides a pre-built set of tools for interacting with Google Drive. These tools make it easy to build agents and AI apps that can:

<Tip>
  If you need to perform an action that's not listed here, you can [get in touch
  with us](mailto:contact@arcade.dev) to request a new tool, or [create your
  own tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) with the [Google auth
  provider](/home/auth-providers/google#using-google-auth-in-custom-tools).

**Parameters**

- **`corpora`** _(enum ([Corpora](/toolkits/productivity/google/reference#corpora)), optional)_ The source of files to list. Defaults to `Corpora.USER`.
- **`title_keywords`** _(list[str], optional)_ Keywords or phrases that must be in the document title. Defaults to `None`.
- **`order_by`** _(enum ([OrderBy](/toolkits/productivity/google/reference#orderby)), optional)_ Sort order. Defaults to `OrderBy.MODIFIED_TIME_DESC`.
- **`supports_all_drives`** _(bool, optional)_ Whether the requesting application supports both My Drives and shared drives. Defaults to `False`.
- **`limit`** _(int, optional)_ The number of documents to list. Defaults to `50`.

## Auth

The Arcade Drive toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google) to connect to users' Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only, not
  for production use. To use Arcade and Google Drive in production, you must
  use a self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.
