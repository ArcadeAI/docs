<TabbedCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "Call the Tool with User Authorization",
      content: {
        Python: [
          "/examples/integrations/toolkits/google/calendar/list_events_example_call_tool.py",

        JavaScript: ["Coming Soon"],
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

List events from the specified calendar within the given datetime range.

min_end_datetime serves as the lower bound (exclusive) for an event's end time. max_start_datetime serves as the upper bound (exclusive) for an event's start time.

For example: If min_end_datetime is set to 2024-09-15T09:00:00 and max_start_datetime is set to 2024-09-16T17:00:00, the function will return events that:

1. End after 09:00 on September 15, 2024 (exclusive)
2. Start before 17:00 on September 16, 2024 (exclusive) This means an event starting at 08:00 on September 15 and ending at 10:00 on September 15 would be included, but an event starting at 17:00 on September 16 would not be included.

**Parameters**

- **`min_end_datetime`** _(string, required)_ Filter by events that end on or after this datetime in ISO 8601 format, e.g., '2024-09-15T09:00:00'.
- **`max_start_datetime`** _(string, required)_ Filter by events that start before this datetime in ISO 8601 format, e.g., '2024-09-16T17:00:00'.
- **`calendar_id`** _(string, optional)_ The ID of the calendar to list events from
- **`max_results`** _(integer, optional)_ The maximum number of events to return

## Auth

The Arcade AI Calendar toolkit uses the [Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google) to connect to users' Google accounts.

With the hosted Arcade AI Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only, not
  for production use. To use Arcade AI and Google Calendar in production, you
  must use a self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade AI, you need to [configure the Google auth provider](/home/auth-providers/google#configuring-google-auth) with your own Google app credentials.
