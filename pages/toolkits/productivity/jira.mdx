# Atlassian auth provider

The Atlassian auth provider enables tools and agents to call the Atlassian API on behalf of a user. Behind the scenes, the Arcade Engine and the Atlassian auth provider seamlessly manage Atlassian OAuth 2.0 authorization for your users.

### What's documented here

This page describes how to use and configure Atlassian auth with Arcade.

This auth provider is used by:

- Your [app code](#using-atlassian-auth-in-app-code) that needs to call Atlassian APIs
- Or, your [custom tools](#using-atlassian-auth-in-custom-tools) that need to call Atlassian APIs

## Configuring Atlassian auth

### Create an Atlassian app

- Create a Atlassian app in the [Atlassian developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)
- In the Authorization tab, click the "Add" action button and set the Callback URL to: `https://cloud.arcade.dev/api/v1/oauth/callback`
- In the Permissions tab, enable any permissions you need for your app
- In the Settings tab, copy the Client ID and Secret to use below

Next, add the Atlassian app to your Arcade Engine configuration. You can do this in the Arcade Dashboard, or by editing the `engine.yaml` file directly (for a self-hosted instance).

### Configuring Atlassian auth with the Arcade Dashboard

1. Navigate to the OAuth section of the Arcade Dashboard and click **Add OAuth Provider**.
2. Select **Atlassian** as the provider.
3. Choose a unique **ID** for your provider (e.g. "my-atlassian-provider") with an optional **Description**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Atlassian app.
5. Click **Save**.

When you use tools that require Atlassian auth using your Arcade account credentials, the Arcade Engine will automatically use this Atlassian OAuth provider.

### Configuring Atlassian auth in self-hosted Arcade Engine configuration

<Steps>

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
export ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
```

Or, you can set these values in a `.env` file:

```bash
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your client secret>"
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID="<your client ID>"
```

<Tip>
  See [Engine configuration](/home/local-deployment/configure/engine) for more information on how
  to set environment variables and configure the Arcade Engine.
</Tip>

### Edit the Engine configuration

Edit the `engine.yaml` file and add a `atlassian` item to the `auth.providers` section:

```yaml file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/config_provider.engine.yaml {3-9}

```

</Steps>

## Using Atlassian auth in app code

Use the Atlassian auth provider in your own agents and AI apps to get a user token for the Atlassian API. See [authorizing agents with Arcade](/home/auth/how-arcade-helps) to understand how this works.

Use `client.auth.start()` to get a user token for the Atlassian API:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JavaScript"]} storageKey="preferredLanguage">
<Tabs.Tab>

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/custom_auth.py {8-12}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```javascript file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/custom_auth.js {8-10}

```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Atlassian auth in custom tools

You can author your own [custom tools](/home/build-tools/create-a-toolkit) that interact with the Atlassian API.

Use the `Atlassian()` auth class to specify that a tool requires authorization with Atlassian. The `context.authorization.token` field will be automatically populated with the user's Atlassian token:

```python file=<rootDir>/examples/code/integrations/atlassian/custom_tool.py {5-6,9-13,23}

```
