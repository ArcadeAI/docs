## Auth

The Arcade X (Twitter) toolkit uses the [X auth provider](/home/auth-providers/x) to connect to users' X (formerly Twitter) accounts.

With the hosted Arcade Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade, you need to [configure the X auth provider](/home/auth-providers/x#configuring-x-auth) with your own X (formerly Twitter) app credentials.
