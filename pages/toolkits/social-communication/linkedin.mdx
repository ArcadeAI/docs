## Auth

The Arcade AI LinkedIn toolkit uses the [LinkedIn auth provider](/integrations/auth/linkedin) to connect to users' LinkedIn accounts.

With the hosted Arcade AI Engine, there's nothing to configure. Your users will see `Arcade AI (demo)` as the name of the application that's requesting permission.

<Warning type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The hosted Arcade Engine is intended for demo and testing purposes only, not
  for production use. To use Arcade AI and Google Calendar in production, you
  must use a self-hosted instance of the Arcade Engine.
</Warning>

With a self-hosted installation of Arcade AI, you need to [configure the LinkedIn auth provider](/integrations/auth/linkedin#configuring-linkedin-auth) with your own LinkedIn app credentials.
