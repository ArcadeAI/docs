## Integrate Arcade with your Slack workspace

Arcade securely connects your AI agents to APIs, data, code, and other systems via Tools. Our integration for Slack allows Arcade's tools to connect to your Slack workspace, helping your team work more efficiently.

You can leverage this app in Arcade's Playground when you log in to the Arcade Dashboard, or in your own applications.

While the Arcade app for Slack does not directly expose a Large Language Model (LLM) to you, you will likely use Arcade's tools in conjunction with an LLM. When using LLMs, there's always potential to generate inaccurate responses, summaries, or other output.

Arcade's sample app for Slack brings Arcade's powerful AI tool-calling capabilities to your team's everyday conversations. The Arcade app for Slack can:

- Send messages to your Slack channels and direct messages on your behalf
- Find information in your Slack channels and direct messages
- Generate content, summaries, and responses for messages you receive
- and more!

For more details on what tools are available and what scopes they require, see the [Slack toolkit documentation](/toolkits/social-communication/slack).

<Note>
  The Arcade app for Slack requires an active Arcade account. If you don't have one yet, <SignupLink  linkLocation="docs:slack-app-install">sign up for free</SignupLink>.
</Note>

## How it works

<Steps>
### Install the Arcade app for Slack
Click the "Add to Slack" button below to install Arcade in your workspace.

<div className="mt-8 mb-10">
  <a
    href="#"
    id="slackAuthLink"
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      const randomState = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
      const authUrl = `https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=6177955493956.7607723124533&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.arcade-ai.com%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Foauth%2Fcallback&scope=users:read&scope=users:read,channels:history,groups:history,im:history,mpim:history&user_scope=channels:read,chat:write,groups:read,im:read,im:write,mpim:read,users.profile:read,users:read,users:read.email&state=${randomState}`;
      window.open(authUrl, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');
    }}
    style={{ display: 'inline-block' }}
  >
    <img
      alt="Add to Slack"
      height="40"
      width="139"
      src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png"
      srcSet="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x"
    />
  </a>
</div>

<Warning>
  You'll need to be a workspace admin or have permission to install apps to add Arcade to your Slack workspace.
</Warning>

### Invite Arcade to your channels
Invite Arcade to any channel or direct message by typing `/invite @Arcade` to allow it to read and interact with content in that channel.

### Start using Arcade's Slack tools
Use Arcade's [tools for Slack](/toolkits/social-communication/slack) to:
- Send messages to channels and DMs
- Find information in conversations
- Generate summaries of discussions

Try leveraging the Arcade tools for Slack in the Arcade Playground by [chatting with an LLM](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/playground/chat) asking, "What are the last 5 messages in the general Slack channel?" or [executing Slack tools directly](https://api.arcade.dev/dashboard/playground/execute?toolId=GetMessagesInChannelByName&toolkits=%5B%5D&authProviders=%5B%5D&secrets=%5B%5D&input=%7B%22owner%22%3A%22ArcadeAI%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22arcade-ai%22%2C%22starred%22%3A%22true%22%2C%22channel_name%22%3A%22general%22%2C%22limit%22%3A%225%22%7D) without interacting with an LLM.

<Warning>
  When using LLMs with Slack, responses may sometimes contain inaccuracies. Always review AI-generated content before taking action.
</Warning>

</Steps>

## Next steps

The Arcade app for Slack is a sample for what Arcade can do with your Slack workspace. It's likely that for your own applications you'll need to [create your own app for Slack](/home/auth-providers/slack). Creating your own application for Slack will allow you to brand the app, customize the permissions, and more.
