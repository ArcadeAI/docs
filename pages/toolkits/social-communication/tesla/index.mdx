# Tesla Toolkit

<Callout type="info">
  This toolkit requires the [Tesla auth provider](/home/auth-providers/tesla).
</Callout>

The Tesla toolkit allows your agents to interact with Tesla vehicles through the [Tesla Fleet API](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/what-is-fleet-api). With this toolkit, your agents can:

- Get information about Tesla vehicles
- Control vehicle features (climate, doors, etc.)
- Monitor vehicle status and location
- Manage charging settings

## Getting Started

To use the Tesla toolkit, you'll need to:

1. Set up the [Tesla auth provider](/home/auth-providers/tesla)
2. Install the Tesla toolkit

```bash
pip install arcade-tesla
```

## Example Usage

```python
from arcade import ArcadeClient
from arcade.tools import ModelAPI

# Initialize the Arcade client
client = ArcadeClient()

# Create a model API instance with the Tesla toolkit
model_api = ModelAPI(
    client=client,
    model="gpt-4",
    tools=["tesla"]
)

# Run the model with a prompt
response = model_api.run(
    "Check the battery level of my Tesla and turn on the climate control if it's below 20%."
)

print(response.content)
```
